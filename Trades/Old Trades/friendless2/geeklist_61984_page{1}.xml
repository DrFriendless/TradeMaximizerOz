<title>Australian Maths Trade, Christmas 2010, now with CASH!</title>
<description>This is about the 5th Aussie maths trade. I&#039;ve lost count. However, as I am brave I am going to slightly change the rules this time. Please discuss rules changes on this companiondiscussion thread:

http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/594880/maths-trade-discussion-thread-december-2010-janu

By posting an item to this list you are agreeing that [u]you can mail it anywhere in Australia at your expense[/u]. If it looks like that&#039;s going to cost a lot, make sure you don&#039;t trade it for something crap.

The first rule change (compared to previous Australian Maths Trades) is that I will be more lenient with regards to removal of items from the list. Please remove an item if it is no longer available, so as to avoid confusion and broken promises. However I will lock the list at the appropriate time and then of course you&#039;ll be unable to change anything.

The second rule change is that I will be allowing cash bids. We have discussed this at length on this thread:

http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/483458/australian-ultimate-trade-subscription-thread-and

and the consensus is that it may be a great idea, it may be a crap idea, but if someone wants to try it they might as well. Of course, as with all maths trades, the results will always be consistent with what you want. More details below. The motivation for this is to allow people with more games to get rid of than they want to receive to decrease their number of games whilst still getting something of value in exchange; and alternately, so that people who have nothing to trade can participate.

[b]Specific Rules:[/b]
This trade is open to Australian BGGers only.

This trade is open to board games, expansions, card games, game accessories, and the like. Please don&#039;t add anything else. If you intend to allow a game to be exchanged for cash (i.e. you&#039;re selling), please include the amount you will accept for it in the price. My guiding philosophy in the design of the cash bidding system is that there be no nasty surprises.

Having said that, make sure you understand that in ALL cases, [u]SENDER PAYS SHIPPING[/u]. Even if you&#039;re selling a game for cash, [u]SENDER PAYS SHIPPING[/u]. Even to Perth or Townsville or Hobart. So, make sure you set your price high enough that you would be happy to pay shipping to anywhere else in Australia out of that money. [u]SENDER PAYS SHIPPING[/u].

Also, BGG runs a marketplace where sellers pay 3% commission to BGG, and I believe that tithe should apply here as well. As Aldie&#039;s debt-collectors don&#039;t get over this way very much, I suggest that sellers make a donation of that 3% using the standard BGG donation system.

Buyers will not be required to add cash items to the geeklist - that will be handled in the want lists. In the case that a buyer offers more than a seller is asking, the buyer will pay the seller&#039;s price. Sorry sellers, this is not an auction, this is a maths trade, and you only get as much as you ask for.

[b]Limits:[/b]
Feel free to put as many items on the list as you want. Duplicates of items already on the list are okay. You can combine multiple games into one item (e.g. Carcassonne plus expansions).

Please describe the edition, language, and condition of the game. Pick a picture that represents the game you&#039;re offering if there are multiple versions. If necessary, take a picture of the game, upload it to your gallery, and use that image.

Please count pieces to make sure the games are complete, and accurately list any components that are missing or damaged. Please look at your trade pile to make sure the game is really there.

In order to make your items more (or less) appealing, you may want to add one or more &quot;sweeteners&quot; to the item listing -- an expansion, a related game, or a completely unrelated item that you think will make it a more desirable package.

Items for which there is no BGG listing can be listed as Miscellaneous Game Accessory.

[b]Algorithm:[/b]
Trade lists will be found by TradeMaximizer using SCALED-PRIORITIES, ALLOW-DUMMIES, REQUIRE-COLONS and REQUIRE-USERNAMES switches. The actual code is a heavily modified version of Trade Maximiser 1.3a, modified to allow geeklist integration (as we&#039;ve been using in Australia for a couple of years) and now the cash bids. The (Java) source code will be available to anyone who&#039;s interested.

[b]Deadlines:[/b]
Add items to, and remove items from the list by: 6pm Wednesday January 5, 2011.
Official item list posted by: 6pm Thursday January 6, 2011.
Want Lists Due By: 6pm Monday January 10, 2011.
Official Results Posted By: 6pm Tuesday January 11, 2011. There really is no leeway for that, as people need to pack and head off to the Australian Games Expo in Canberra for the 22nd. It&#039;s hoped by many traders that physical exchange of games can take place at AGE. These dates have been changed to match the dates that worked in last year&#039;s New Year trade.

Format:
The official item list will be of a format something like:
001-TWIXT
002-BMOON
003-PUERT
004-TICHU

Want lists must be submitted in a format like

(your user name-Friendless) 001-TWIXT : 004-TICHU 002-BMOON

indicating that Friendless, the person who put item 001, a Twixt game, into the list would be willing to accept either item 004, a Tichu game, or item 002, Blue Moon, in trade for it. The order of listing is your order of preference, in case both trades are possible.

The order of wants is a tiebreaker only. The system will first try to maximise the number of trades, even if this means that you get your last preference. The order of your wants will only be considered if there are multiple ways to get the maximum trades. But, fear not! You will never get a game that is not on your want list.

If you put 5 games on this trade list, you will be submitting 5 different want lists. 

You may also submit want lists for cash bids. In that case, you write something like this:

(your user name-Friendless) $20 : 004-TICHU 002-BMOON

meaning that Friendless has $20 and he&#039;ll pay it for either Tichu or Blue Moon. You could also write this:

(your user name-Friendless) $10 : 004-TICHU
(your user name-Friendless) $20 : 002-BMOON

meaning that Friendless will pay $10 for Tichu and $20 for Blue Moon, so Friendless could be up for $30 total. To ensure that you don&#039;t spend all of your beer money, you can add a spending limit just like this:

(your user name-Friendless) LIMIT : $30

which means that no matter what happens, Friendless won&#039;t win trades such that he has to spend more than $30. I&#039;ll tell you how that works. We run the trade algorithm, and inspect the results. If anyone has exceeded their spending limit, their highest-priced successful bid is removed and the algorithm is re-run. Continue until all spending limits are satisfied. If you don&#039;t specify a spending limit, the program infers a limit which is the highest amount you&#039;ve been for any single item. That will be a rather conservative limit, but follows the maxim of no nasty surprises.

To sell a game, you can submit a trade list like this:

(your user name-Friendless) 001-TWIXT : 004-TICHU 002-BMOON $30

meaning that for Twixt Friendless will accept Tichu, or Blue Moon, or $30 from anyone who&#039;s offering cash.

Finally, do not try to screw the system. The program will reject nonsense like this:

(Friendless) $10: $20
(Friendless) %CASH: $20
(Friendless) $10: %CASH
(Friendless) $20: $10

and furthermore I reserve the right to change the program to reject anything else I see as a scam and not an honest trade. Any questions and discussion on the companion thread here please:

What does &quot;trades only&quot; mean?

You can&#039;t control what the person who [b]receives[/b] your game [b]gives[/b] to the next person in exchange for it, you can only control what you [b]receive[/b] by listing what you&#039;ll accept for it in your want list.

Example:

In your trade list you say that you [u]won&#039;t accept cash for your game[/u] (Game X) only one of a list of other games, which includes Game Y.

Person A says they&#039;ll pay $60 for your game, Game X.

Person B says they&#039;ll they&#039;ll accept $50 for Game Y.

In this example the trade would be completed by:

Person A paying $50 to Person B &amp; receiving Game Y [b]from you[/b], Person B accepting $50 from Person A &amp; sending you Game X, &amp; you receiving Game X from Person B &amp; sending Game Y to Person A.

Just because you write &quot;trades only&quot; does not mean that people should not offer money for your game - it&#039;s just that they won&#039;t be giving money to you.

I hope that &quot;trades only&quot; doesn&#039;t stop people offering money for games they want &amp; thus limiting the number of trades that actually result.

Please correct me if I&#039;ve got this wrong.  If I&#039;m correct please consider removing &quot;trades only&quot; as it may just confuse some people &amp; limit the number of trades that occur.

Ben, you are totally correct. I plugged your example into the program and it said &quot;Ben is totally correct&quot;. The input file is this:

[q]#! SCALED-PRIORITIES ALLOW-DUMMIES REQUIRE-COLONS REQUIRE-USERNAMES
(PersonA) $60: GAMEX
(PersonB) GAMEY: $50
(You) GAMEX: GAMEY[/q]

and the output is this. In this case, the &quot;money&quot; mentioned will be $50, that&#039;s the bit I don&#039;t have working nicely yet.

[q]TradeMaximizer Version 1.3.Friendless
SPENDING LIMITS
PERSONA $60

Options: SCALED-PRIORITIES ALLOW-DUMMIES REQUIRE-COLONS REQUIRE-USERNAMES


PERSONA 50 60
TRADE LOOPS (3 total trades):

money from PERSONA receives GAMEX from YOU
GAMEX from YOU     receives GAMEY from PERSONB
GAMEY from PERSONB receives money from PERSONA

ITEM SUMMARY (3 total trades):

GAMEX from YOU     receives GAMEY from PERSONB and sends to money from PERSONA
GAMEY from PERSONB receives money from PERSONA and sends to GAMEX from YOU
money from PERSONA receives GAMEX from YOU     and sends to GAMEY from PERSONB

Num trades  = 3
Total cost  = 3 (avg 1.00)
Num groups  = 1
Group sizes = 3
Sum squares = 9[/q]

The implication of this is that it&#039;s perfectly sensible to bid under what the seller says they&#039;ll accept, in the hope that you get lucky. BUT, you&#039;re more likely to get the game if you bid high.

Inane comments are fine. Just don&#039;t post anything that looks like a trade code, as that will mess up my program.

OK Lets settle this.  Whatever the names/numbers are, here are all the Aussie wide maths trades that have occured:

[geeklist=30938][/geeklist] April 08
[geeklist=35609][/geeklist] Oct 08
[geeklist=37432][/geeklist] April 09
[geeklist=42730][/geeklist] June 09
[geeklist=44833][/geeklist] Dec 09
[geeklist=53341][/geeklist] Mar 10
[geeklist=61984][/geeklist] Dec 10

(BTW it&#039;s interesting to look back and see what has been posted before and also to see the results to know what did and didn&#039;t trade).

I&#039;m going to speak up for all those slow people out there (let&#039;s call them &quot;my people&quot;) that may be a little confused about the money element this year and ask a few quick questions that can hopefully have nice little concise answers that will sit here in the Math Trade for all to see - then I can start posting stuff with confidence.

...Here goes...

:d10-1: Do I need to list acceptable prices for all my items (should I be happy to sell) publicly or do I do that in my lists to John?

:d10-2: Do trades get precedence over cash or will the software simply look for optimum results whether they be trade or cash?

I think that covers it.

NooB out :whistle:

:d10-1: You NEED to do it when you submit your wants. You may do it in the geeklist item. My reasoning as to why you should is here:

http://boardgamegeek.com/article/5948409#5948409

:d10-2: That depends whether I can get the software biased towards game trades. At the moment, it just looks for a largest set of cycles. If I can figure out how to bias it towards game trades rather than cash trades, I will do so, but it will still find a largest set of cycles which will be the same size. It just might contain more games. It depends how much I can grok that bit of the code.

Final NooB question and the last thing that worries me - 


[q=&quot;Friendless&quot;]it is possible to win a game (a) which is not available for cash by offering cash... [/q]

Does this mean that I can put no sale amount on a game but if someone offers cash I could still lose it and be forced to take cash even though that is not my desire?

Nope, someone else would get the cash, and you would get a game you wanted from them. As Sacha says, you won&#039;t be forced to do something against your will. The maxim of the maths trade is No Nasty Surprises. Not like the time your wife tricked me into playing The Dancing Egg Game.

Could I ask that if you need to remove an item from the list that you change it to [thing=20049][/thing] or some such rather than removing it altogether?

The problem with taking an item out is that it changes the numbering of every item after it and therefore stuffs up the list I (and others) create as the GL is populated.

Thanks!

The problem with taking an item out is that it changes the numbering of every item after it and therefore stuffs up the list I (and others) create as the GL is populated.

Thanks!

Is the taking off the list thing due to people getting cash offers privately?

Is that possible or the done thing?

Yeeesh. Noobs. :devil:[/q]

A few more noob-ish question: 

(1) So, if someone doesn&#039;t want to trade anything away, but wants to &#039;buy&#039; items, they won&#039;t post anything on this list but will submit a want list? 

(2) Can someone give a refresher course on how to properly formulate a want list (i.e. how dummies work and everything)?

I don&#039;t know why people want to take things off lists. Sometimes I discover I haven&#039;t actually got the game I&#039;m trying to trade. However consider Tiggers comment above.

If anyone was to PM me and tell me &quot;I&#039;ll take that price now&quot;, I would accept. It&#039;s maybe a little discouraging to others, but I want to get rid of some games!

(1) Yes. If someone I never heard of submits a wants list with $500 worth of cash offers, I will be asking around to see if anyone knows them. The advantage of being a frequent trader is that people get to know you.

(2) Sure. But not right now as I am drunk. Before you need to do it, someone will explain it.

I&#039;m cool with that...I just wanted to check to make sure it was ok before I made some offers.

It will be interesting to see the results though...I&#039;m just curious about the potential for the desirable titles to get purchased before trade...thus reducing the number of trades considerably...in which case we turn the trade into a sale.

I&#039;ll stop talking now and wait to see the results.

Jeez, maths trades get more and more complicated.

Somehow cash offers makes it seem more like Maths Marketplace than a Maths Trade.

@ Neil. People take cash offers all the time. Last time round, a game I was hoping to get in a trade for sold prior to the results being release. With a cash offer now in play, I won&#039;t be surprised if some of these games go early. The gentlemanly thing to do is to PULL THE SOLD GAME from the list. Don&#039;t leave it there if it&#039;s gone. Otherwise people may put in a trade for it. Why waste someone&#039;s time?

I think we should wait and see. 

You may well be right. But we all clearly have differing opinions, based on what we want to get out of the trade.

The way I see it is this is an experiment, if it&#039;s no good it can be banished never to return.

I think we should probably take a vote after it&#039;s all wrapped up and see what the consensus is.

Happy New Year you Aussie Geek-o-philes.

Here&#039;s hoping the list can push on towards 500 items in the closing week.

I&#039;m curious about all the Wargames. Is this simply a case of too many wargames in the cupboard or is it a sign of changing tastes?

As we don&#039;t have a wargames-only trade, I&#039;m happy to see these here too 

In my particular case, I have some duplicates. These are great games and I can potentially hook you up with some PBEM action if you win the SWWAS titles, so no need to play solo. These also can work multiplayer - so add them to your want list now

There&#039;s a bit of Euro-bias there. There are also a bunch of good ameritrash (Battlestar Galactica, Dune, Dungeonquest, Return of the Heroes, Summoner Wars, etc) and presumably the wargames are good too.

Congrats folks, this is officially the largest Aussie wide maths trade.  It beats the previous record of 576 GL items from the very first maths trade waaaaay back in the heady old days of mid &#039;08.

[size=14][u]How to make a Want List[/u][/size]

Given that there are a number of new contributors to the Maths Trade this time around, I felt a reprisal of some strategies for creating a Want List was in order, including some guidelines on how to incorporate the new CASH facility being tried out.

[size=8][i]NOTE: If you identify errors, omissions or suggestions for this post, I would appreciate it if you could please mail them to me and I will update the post rather than have multiple follow-on comments that may just confuse people.[/i][/size]

[b]General guidelines[/b]
TradeMaximizer works on the principle of getting [u]the most number of trades possible[/u]. Thus, the more items you have for each line on your want list, the more likely it is to get a successful trade. However, this also means you need to make sure that [u]every item[/u] on your want list is a satisfactory trade for you... if you&#039;re not going to be content to receive a well-used Munchkin in return for your virgin copy of Queen&#039;s Gambit (and pay postage to Christmas Island for it as well), then don&#039;t put it in.

John has detailed the ALGORITHM to be used, which will likely make little sense to most people. So, in simple terms:
SCALED-PRIORITIES essentially means that each of items [u]on each line[/u] is considered in order, with items appearing earlier being given higher priority for trade success than subsequent items. Thus, when creating each line for your submission, order the items you want in the order you most want them. However, the order of the rows in your list does not matter, and will not affect the trade probibilities.
ALLOW-DUMMIES provides the facility to use an [u]alias[/u] where multiple copies of the same game are available, and you&#039;d be happy to receive one but not more than one. This is covered below.
REQUIRE-COLONS and REQUIRE-USERNAMES are formatting requirements that help reduce the possibility of errors when the engine runs.

A [u]Want List[/u] is a straight text file. It should not have formatting of any sort, but it should be structured correctly - this makes the Admin&#039;s life significantly easier. Each line (row) of your list should be structured in the same way.

[b]Starting the list[/b]
Every item on the trade list has a designated trade code added to it in the format ###-TEXT, and you will need these for each item you want to put in your list.

Firstly, make a list of the games you are interested in receiving. How you do this is up to you; personally, I use a spreadsheet because I can review condition, sweeteners and other comments pretty quickly. Help for doing this is at [url]http://boardgamegeek.com/article/6049234#6049234[/url]. Remember that you need the trade code for each item; a handy place to grab this is from Mr Lunch&#039;s excellent web list at [url]http://zincgames.com/sandpit/bgg-gl-list.php?glid=61984[/url].

Then make a list of any items you have added, [u]beginning each line with your username in brackets[/u] followed by a space, followed by the code for the item you have put up for trade [u]and a colon[/u]:
[COLOR=#0000FF]eg.
(ausminstrel) 530-SEVEN:
(ausminstrel) 531-ADAST:
(ausminstrel) 532-ALADD:
(ausminstrel) 533-LOYAN:
[/COLOR]

[b]Dummies (Aliases)[/b] 
When building the list of items you want you will come across games that are listed multiple times. In the likely circumstance that you&#039;re not one of those people who wants, for example, three copies of Race for the Galaxy (yes, there are people like that!!), you can create a dummy (an alias). This allows you to add the game in more than one line, but the trade engine will only find one success for it - you can only receive one copy!

To create an alias, create a name for it; this can be anything you like, but it must be unique in your list and must be preceded a % sign. Also, don&#039;t forget that, as with any other row on your list, the start of each line must be your username surrounded by brackets and it must have a colon after the submitted item code.

Do this for each game you might want that is listed mutiple times.
[COLOR=#0000FF]eg.
(ausminstrel) %SMARC:
(ausminstrel) %GHEOS:
(ausminstrel) %CIVIL:
[/COLOR]

Then, next to each alias, put the trade code for the items you want. As with a normal want list, these can be in order of preference (for example, you might want to put a version listed as &quot;new&quot; ahead of one listed as &quot;good&quot;, but you&#039;d be happy to get either).

[COLOR=#0000FF]eg.
(ausminstrel) %SMARC: 587-SANMA 611-SANMA
(ausminstrel) %GHEOS: 496-GHEOS 152-GHEOS 410-GHEOS
(ausminstrel) %CIVIL: 627-CIVIL 642-CIVIL
[/COLOR]

[b]Trading games for games[/b]
Now, to each row of the list of games you submitted, add codes for any of the games you would be happy to receive in trade, leaving a space between each one. You may have items in more than one line (ie. you would trade any of several of your items for a particular item). Where you are adding a game used in your alias list, [u]use the alias code rather than the individual item code[/u].

As noted above, you may be required to pay postage to anywhere in the country, so bear that in mind at all times when deciding what you&#039;d be happy to receive in return.

Also remember that the TradeMaximizer will weigh trades earlier in the row as more desirable than those later, so prioritise.

[COLOR=#0000FF]eg.
(ausminstrel) 530-SEVEN: %CIVIL 244-REDPL
(ausminstrel) 531-ADAST: 244-REDPL %CIVIL
(ausminstrel) 532-ALADD: 246-BLUEM 237-MOTAB %GHEOS %SMARC
(ausminstrel) 533-LOYAN: 236-GOANA 
[/COLOR]

Trades work one-for-one, so one offer on each line gets matched against one possible item. Thus, REDPL appearing on two rows can obviously only trade once, for one of my items. Also, alias items only trade once; so, ALADD might trade for BLUEM or MOTAB or a copy of GHEOS (in which case nothing else would trade for GHEOS) or a copy of SMARC (in which case nothing else would trade for SMARC).

[b]Trading cash[/b]
For the first time, CASH is being used as an option in this trade. This allows contributors to both offer cash in trade for an item, and/or accept cash as a suitable trade.

If you are happy to accept cash for one of your submissions, simply add the amount to the relevant row of your want list.
[COLOR=#0000FF]eg.
(ausminstrel) 533-LOYAN : 236-GOANA $50
[/COLOR]

If you want to offer cash for one or more items, add it as a row as you would a game, remembering correct syntax for the row: your username in brackets, offer, colon, items.
[COLOR=#0000FF]eg.
(ausminstrel) $90: 001-CONFL
[/COLOR]

[i]Bear in mind that there is not necessarily a correlation between the amount you offer and the amount requested for any particular item. Because the methodology of a maths trade is not A &amp;lt;--&amp;gt; B, but may be A --&amp;gt; B --&amp;gt; C --&amp;gt; A (or even more complex), you could conceivably offer more or less for an item than the person requests and still end up with a successful trade. You can also make cash offers for items not submitted with a value and get a successful trade.[/i]

However, the simple rule to remember is that trades can only be matched against the items on each row of your list... if you offer something (cash or game) you can only receive respective items you specify (be they cash or game). You cannot possibly end up with a trade you have not requested.

John has also created code that allows you to specify an overall spending limit, so that the [u]sum[/u] of any possible trades will not exceed that limit. Use LIMIT as the code and the same syntax...
[COLOR=#0000FF]eg.
(ausminstrel) LIMIT: $100
[/COLOR]

[b]Finishing off[/b]
When you&#039;re done, put it all together and check your syntax: [u]every line[/u] needs to start with your username (in brackets), have a row identifier (alias name, item code, offer or limit), a colon, and a list of acceptable trade items (code, alias and/or amount).
[COLOR=#0000FF]eg.
(ausminstrel) %SMARC: 587-SANMA 611-SANMA
(ausminstrel) %GHEOS: 496-GHEOS 152-GHEOS 410-GHEOS
(ausminstrel) %CIVIL: 627-CIVIL 642-CIVIL
(ausminstrel) 530-SEVEN: %CIVIL 244-REDPL
(ausminstrel) 531-ADAST: 244-REDPL %CIVIL
(ausminstrel) 532-ALADD: 246-BLUEM 237-MOTAB %GHEOS %SMARC
(ausminstrel) 533-LOYAN: 236-GOANA $50
(ausminstrel) $90: 001-CONFL
(ausminstrel) $10: 002-BLOOD
(ausminstrel) $100: %CIVIL
(ausminstrel) LIMIT: $100
[/COLOR]

Thus...
For SEVEN, I may receive a copy of CIVIL or REDPL, and for ADAST I may receive a copy of REDPL or CIVIL, but if I get CIVIL for one it will not trade for any other item on my list (including the cash offer).
For ALADD I may receive BLUEM or MOTAB or a copy of GHEOS (in which case nothing else would trade for GHEOS) or a copy of SMARC (in which case nothing else would trade for SMARC).
For LOYAN I may receive GOANA  or I may receive $50. However, if GOANA trades elsewhere and nobody offers $50 for a trade combination, my LOYAN will not trade. Therefore, the more items I am willing to accept in trade the greater the chance of it successfully trading.
I may pay (up to) $90 to receive CONFL, regardless of how much the contributor requests for it.
I may pay $10 for BLOOD, or $100 for a copy of CIVIL, but I will not get if the total would exceed my LIMIT.


When you&#039;re done, copy it into a Geekmail and sent to [user=Friendless][/user] [b]Remember to say thankyou[/b] because it&#039;s a difficult and time consuming job running all this. And some people have real lives that interfere with their BoardGameGeek time.

I hope this helps some of you.

Just one query. In your example under the [u][b]Finishing Off[/b][/u] heading, should there also be three lines to define %CIVIL, %GHEOS and %SMARC ?

Can I say both you and John have written very clear explanations.
I&#039;ve read them both which means I noticed this:

[q=&quot;ausminstrel&quot;]I may pay $90 to receive CONFL, regardless of how much the contributor requests for it.
[/q]

You may, in fact, pay less than $90 to receive CONFL. But you&#039;ll never pay more than $90 for it.

Just noticed that both Tribunes have different letter codes - 

353-PRIMU 551-TRIBU

Will that matter when making a % want list?

Is this valid? 

%PRIMU: 353-PRIMU 551-TRIBU

As it doesn&#039;t follow the code outlined in the example where all games of same type have same letter coding.

Yes, that would work Hida. And no, it doesn&#039;t matter Neil, as long as you use the correct codes. The engine doesn&#039;t care what they are called, as long as they are called something (and have the correct format).

The games in a dummy list do not actually need to be the same game at all; as long as you understand the engine will only allow one match from the list.

Thus, you could also do something like:
[COLOR=#0000FF]
(ausminstrel) %MY100: 001-GAMEA 002-GAMEB 003-GAMEC 004-GAMED
(ausminstrel) %MY050: 005-GAMEE 006-GAMEF
(ausminstrel) $100: %MY100
(ausminstrel) $50: %MY050
[/COLOR]
which would allow you offer up to $100 for any one (and only one) of the games off the first list, and up to $50 for any one (and only one) of the games off the second list.

I asked Julian about this, and he&#039;s somewhat keen. Remember though that it does take up space (for which he&#039;s being charged). The only proper solution is to buy lots of stuff from him while you&#039;re there. And of course, be neat, considerate, and label everything really really well with who it&#039;s to and who it&#039;s from.

It would also be useful to have some idea of the likelihood of games hitching a ride to thier new owners.... That could affect the $estimate I&#039;d put on my games. (I&#039;m willing to take a postage loss if I&#039;m likely to only be posting a small percentage of games.)
Melbourne: I&#039;m aware of a few people driving (including myself) so transport there could be ok.
What about other cities?
John or Kevin, are you likely to be able to take much home?
Ben, Alvin, Brendan, et al? Transport options to Adelaide?

Perhaps if willing couriers could put thier hands up?

Does it matter that the game code &quot;SEVEN&quot; is used for 2 different games?[/q]

Not at all. They could be deadly sins for all the trade program cares, it&#039;s just shuffling codes around. It also doesn&#039;t matter if the numbers don&#039;t match those in the geeklist. However, when people send want lists to me it is very important that they use the trade codes from the geeklist, and not some that they made up themselves. That&#039;s probably the most common mistake.

Thanks for the efforts, John. Great work.

Mental note for the future, make sure you check the games you want... Just wound up with a 1985 edition of a game instead of the new one I thought it was. Silly me!

	<body>Base game. Good condition. Corners of the box have some minor wear. Looks like a first edition as it has the red FFG symbol on the corner of the box (as opposed to the silver symbol), and the previous owner has included a printout of the 2006 FAQ (I picked up this copy on the Australian Chain of Generosity a while ago).

This is in used condition (it is from 1982!) and is apparently quite rare. The box is still very sturdy, but has slight wear from sitting undisturbed for what looks to be a long time. 

Blue and red pawns are unpunched. The only components missing are 1 yellow pawn, 1 black pawn and about 4 coins out of 50. Rulebook is present and in good condition.

I&#039;ll be at AGE. </body>

Well of course it does - everyone knows that Alan R. Moon is much more [b][-]insane[/-][/b] inane than Knizia.

Pay attention now Shawn.

If you had been sitting on a shelf undisturbed for a long time you would probably be looking a bit worn yourself.

	<body>Dune. Sting edition.

It is old, worn and much loved and still very playable. Only signs of extreme age are the rules are photocopied and a couple of counters are replaced with cutouts from the sprue (but aren&#039;t that obvious). I love the game, but it never sees table time.

As I am trying to cull my collection I will accept money for this ($90).</body>

	<body>Copy of one of the darlings of the ameritrash movement Thunder Road in very good condition. All pieces accounted for with no noticeable problems (apart from being 15 years old). Wasn&#039;t as much fun as I was lead to believe by the crowd at F:AT so it never sees table time.

As with micromutants below, I didn&#039;t put a price in yet as I hadn&#039;t worked out what I thought was fair. I will get around to it eventually with micromutants, but as that isn&#039;t available in Australia it&#039;s hard to get a good estimate.

The method I&#039;m using is to look at Milsims, look at BGG marketplace, and undercut both of them considering shipping costs and the condition of the game I&#039;m listing.

I even got extra cultists from Fantasy Flight to replace the ones where the symbols have fallen off (included in trade). 

Too many rules for our group of gamers and since we don&#039;t have a core group, didn&#039;t want to keep teaching the game again and again. Otherwise, looks like an enjoyable game.

For some people, it&#039;s not only a creative outlet, it&#039;s the only personality they have. I&#039;m perfectly comfortable with the idea of swapping games in my collection for cash so I can buy new games which aren&#039;t available for trade. However in all likelihood I will sell so little I will only be able to put a deposit on a new set of IKEA shelves to store the trade pile on.

This is actually one of the more fun word games I&#039;ve played. You should play it-- I think you&#039;d like it. You have to find paths which use letters to make a word-- and you can use letters in the path more than once if you can loop the path.

	<body>Previous game was reclaimed by [i]Scrabblette[/i], so is no longer for trade. Instead I offer a barely used copy of Totem Land. This may be a cunning game, but as [i]Scrabblette[/i] refuses to play it, I&#039;ll never find out. That&#039;s the exact copy in the photo. Scenery not included.

[-]Very good condition, despite having Coke spilled on it once. There is not a hint of stickiness anywhere. A very beautiful game with light strategy (so not a sequel to the Mask series), but which I appreciate. $35[/-]</body>

Box is worn at the corners and bent on the top, but intact.

Randy, my heartful sympathy goes out to you. It is just so unfair that you are maligned this way. Just so unfair. I just can&#039;t believe that John wrote that. And to think that 11 people gave it a thumbs up is unforgivable. Be strong and carry on.

David

P.S. the game is still available if you want it.

This is the German edition - it is in excellent condition and the components look great. It is quite playable by non-German speakers as I have copied the English rules and typed up translations of the information you need to play the game.</body>

Of course - I didn&#039;t know there was an unboxed version.

But, if you want it unboxed that can be arranged.

Thanks for that. :)

I already have the &#039;unboxed&#039; version, aka the portfolio version, released by Avalon Hill in a bagged format with a magazine style rule book.  It&#039;s ok but only has a paper map so I&#039;ve been keen to find a boxed copy for a while.

11 character cards (thicker cardboard stock) - good condition

The following cards all in excellent condition:

- Tower x5
- Talisman x6
- Spell x30
- Purchase x48 (game claims 40 but 48 seems to be the actual number)
- Adventure x128 (1 missing)

Components as follows all in good condition:
- x3 6-dice (3 missing - looks like normal small white dice, easy substitute)
- 11 Alignment Counters (1 Evil missing)
- Coins in different denominations x27 (5 missing)
- Miniatures in good condition &amp; unpainted (4 are still on sprues unpunched) - only the Warrior is missing but a painted metal wardancer miniature is included to substitute
- 28 red strength counters (2 missing)
- 21 green life counters (9 missing)
- 22 blue craft counters (8 missing)
- 18 purple experience counters (2 missing)

Summary of missing components as follows but what is in the box is excellent condition - x1 warrior miniature, 3 small 6-sided dice, 1 Adventure Card, 1 Evil Alignment card, 5 coins, counters (2 red, 9 green, 8 blue, 2 purple).</body>

	<body>A stack of old card games. All in good condition, some in shrink.

I should also make a note about the quantity here; I couldn&#039;t fit all this stuff into a shoebox. It&#039;s a big lot of cards.

Includes:

[thing=3848][/thing] starter
[thing=1800][/thing] starter
[thing=35288][/thing]
Vroom (I&#039;ll have to add this one to the database...)
[thing=19766][/thing]
[thing=2139][/thing]
[thing=14038][/thing]
[thing=4110][/thing]
[thing=2640][/thing]
[thing=9959][/thing]
[thing=1799][/thing]
[thing=7181][/thing]

Will accept cash $30, Will be at AGE. If just want part of this lot, contact me, I&#039;ll happily part with it for very little.</body>

Alas, my group deemed it &quot;too complex&quot; so its been on shelf since.

I have the Deluxe one now so this is pretty redundant. Off to a good home / cold war afficionado :)

100% complete and comes with the tokens bagged into different denominations.

Cards were sleeved but I used those sleeves for the deluxe edition.

Complete. Components in great shape; box top is *slightly* dipped from shelfwear and has tape on one corner. 
Game is languange independent, but the rules are in Dutch (at least I think it&#039;s Dutch). I&#039;ll include printed English original rules and revised rules.

	<body>This is actually one of around 80 games from my collection that I&#039;m selling.  (I started with a list of over 100, but things have been going quickly.)  If you would like to see the list and buy directly from me, check out http://thesecretbreadempire.blogspot.com/2010/12/massive-game-sale-everything-must-go.html

Excellent condition.  This is the out-of-print, highly-desired 1999 edition by Hasbro/Avalon Hill that features big plastic pieces and colourful hotels.  An all-time classic game designed by Sid Sackson.

I&#039;m probably only interested in trading this for money, as there&#039;s not really anything else I need right now.  I&#039;m asking $110 for this Maths Trade to make sure that I&#039;m covered for postage anywhere in Australia.  But if you&#039;d like to buy it for $80 plus my actual postage costs, you can just contact me directly.  And, again, I&#039;ve got a bunch of other games you might be interested in, also!

I&#039;ll be at AGE.  I&#039;m currently located in Brisbane.</body>

Hi all. I decided that posting a box full of wood is ridiculous. If there are Brisbane gamers who are interested I will trade or sell it locally. Same for anyone who is able to arrange postage free delivery.

From the description on the game page:

The included firefights, most of which you can play in about an hour, are designed to depict the pivotal points in a given battle. You can learn enough of the game to play the first scenario in 10 minutes thanks to the [u]programmed instruction approach [/u]used in the full-color rulebook.

I haven&#039;t played the game, but this is kinda like a turorial. It introduces more and more with each scenario.

You should have no problem playing this game, but do you have opponents for it?

Neil - I know you love M44.  This game is similar but it gives each player far greater control of how they use each unit.  Primarily because of action points rather than randomly drawn cards as the main mechanic.  There are a number of specific/technical elements to learn but once you know them they don&#039;t seem complicated.  I&#039;m not saying this is better or worse than M44 but I do prefer it for the reasons above.  It [i]may [/i]not click for you, but I do think you&#039;d like it.  I don&#039;t know about your limitations but if I (an almost exclusive eurogamer) can handle and enjoy it, I&#039;m sure you&#039;ll have no problems.

I got this game because I heard was like Memoir, but found it to be much more like ASL SK1, which was interesting and enlightening, but too heavy for my tastes.

I was actually thinking Great Nick was Santa. Which would make him some kind of anti-Santa if he goes around eating up gamers components. It&#039;s like a scary bedtime story for BGG&#039;ers. :sauron:

The Dragon&#039;s Tower expansion. The expansion is complete (other than the miniatures), but the Dragon is broken (though nicely painted and can be mostly repaired with some glue by someone with more skill in these things than me).

Here&#039;s the odd thing. It&#039;s in the box for Dungeon of Doom

	<body>I think it is time to move on my baby. I love this game, but it hasn&#039;t been played in 10+ years for various reasons so I think it is time to see if someone else will love this as much as I do.

It is complete and in good condition, apart from the giant cardboard buildings which are long gone (as there was no place to store them assembled, and if memory serves required glue to assemble, so disassembly was impossible).</body>

What they said.  

I hadn&#039;t rushed to play it based on graphics and large number of games available to try, but had the opportunity to try it at Con Vic this year and am very happy I did.  Have played a lot of games on Yucata and BSW since, received a copy for Xmas and have already played 3 games.

There&#039;s a lot of game in that box.

Wot everyone else said: an excellent game with two or four players, and  very, very good with three. This is quite likely my most played Euro. The expansion is interesting, but not on the same level as the base game. Find someone to teach you St Pete&#039;s - you will be pleased you did (my thanks to Gregor :-)

	<body>This is the 3M version - similar to the one pictured. Cardboard pieces and stands. Small box.

Comes from a pet free, smoke free household. Played 2 or 3 times. Great game, trading it because I was able to get the version with plastic pieces. 

:star: [u][b]Shipping Restrictions [/b][/u]:star:

These restrictions are not about where but about when. That is, I [i]will[/i] post anywhere in Australia however I will not [i]be able to post until [/i]Mid February.

The (short) reason: We are moving from Adelaide to Dimboola in Victoria and our stuff has already been packed and is being held by the removalists. However before we arrive there we are on holidays for all of January (and most of December). The move itself will take place during the first week of Feb and I will get the games out as soon after that as I can. Apologies for the delay in posting games but this trade has come and can’t be denied!

Any questions please geekmail me.

Very good condition.

Part of my &#039;must purge the old DoW&#039; phase I&#039;m going through. Seems easier than a mid life crisis.

We have the 2-player version now and this is more for the multi-player crowd.

	<body>Comes as the edition pictured, played a few times but it just didn&#039;t grab my gaming group. 

Comes from a smoke free, pet free household. 

Near perfect condition, if memory serves me correctly, one of the units from the green army was damaged when it was poped from the cardboard (this is why you should always prep games yourself and not let others &quot;help&quot;). Has been repaired but you can tell which one it was. Does not affect game play.

These restrictions are not about where but about when. That is, I [i]will[/i] post anywhere in Australia however I will not [i]be able to post until [/i]Mid February.

The (short) reason: We are moving from Adelaide to Dimboola in Victoria and our stuff has already been packed and is being held by the removalists. However before we arrive there we are on holidays for all of January (and most of December). The move itself will take place during the first week of Feb and I will get the games out as soon after that as I can. Apologies for the delay in posting games but this trade has come and can’t be denied!

But then I wanted to get all the expansions for it, in particular the [thing=19892]Midnight[/thing] expansion. When I found out just how much was available for it and that Midnight is almost impossible to get my passion for the game cooled.

Hmm - to make this as easy as possible I&#039;ll remove the local discount and trust that no-one in Perth is interested in my games anyway!

Well, we played this last night, TWICE!! It has been claimed by my family, so I will be entering an empty trade list for it.

Sorry for the late notice, but I have been caught up with work and meant to get this in before John added the code. :blush:

[-]Received in 2009 International Secret Santa as a used copy. I haven&#039;t got it to the table so out it goes. It&#039;s in very good condition.

Also includes [thing=31420][/thing]
 
[ImageID=252723]

Both [i]Cutthroat Caverns[/i] and [i]Deeper and Darker[/i] have been played once. All the components have been bagged separately and the game is in excellent condition. They are stored together in the [i]CC[/i] box; I cannot find the box for [i]DD[/i] so expect them to come together.

The game was very engaging and normally I would keep it, but we have [thing=59946]Castle Ravenloft[/thing], [thing=10547][/thing], [thing=15987][/thing] and [thing=8095][/thing]! Poor [i]Cutthroat Caverns[/i] has not made it back to the table due to all the competition. </body>

[i]Ricochet Robots[/i] has been played about 10 times and is VGC. Many people find it interesting, but [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/user/Aneirin]Aneirin[/url] was mostly bored, and I want to play games rather than doing puzzles. Hopefully someone will find the joy.
[i]Court of the Medici[/i] has been played about 5 times, and it is also VGC. Sadly, neither of us can understand why people are excited about it. We have [i]Jaipur[/i], [i]Aton [/i]and [i]St Petersburg[/i]: [i]CotM [/i]doesn&#039;t stand a chance.

VGC. Most of the flags have their stickers attached, the remainder are still in the box waiting to be done. All parts present and well cared for. Box shows slight traces of shelf-wear.
This is a great game - I have a duplicate copy that is NIS :D</body>

I believe he went into his back yard, looked under a cabbage...and there it was.

I can&#039;t remember whether he exlaimed &#039;voila&#039; or &#039;eureka&#039;. Come to think of it, I believe he was naked so he probably said &quot;Eureka!&quot;

You should check the footage from your spy-cam more carefully. I was wearing a single, purple, size 11-13 woollen sock. (Practising to cover a RHCP song), And I said &quot;Right on time!&quot; :arrrh:

The NIS copy came from a recent maths trade, while the copy I&#039;m trading was bought on eBay, from someone not unknown here. [/i]

Opened, but unpunched and unplayed. Rules are really interesting. I bought this because I could not get a copy of [thing=17396][/thing] and had not yet discovered [thing=21050][/thing]. Of course, I have both of those now. Everything is present and [i]Chainmail[/i] is good as new.</body>

Question though- why are you offering two of these as one item? Couldn&#039;t they be offered independently?

Not sure whether many will see this now that the deadline for trade lists is approaching but thought i&#039;d give some background / info to address questions in the comments.

I rediscovered board games a couple of years ago now and one of the things I enjoy is pimping my games.  Further to this, I&#039;ve never enjoyed seeing board position / scoring markers etc.. accidently scattered by an overzealous roll or unfortunate richocet.  Hence, on discovering dice towers, I was keen to add some to my collection.

I am fortunate to have a Dad who is a pretty skilled wood worker.  So, after searching the web for some designs, we worked on some ideas for making some solid wood dice towers.  If memory serves, we (predominantly Dad) have made 3 batches:

v1:  Our first attempts using blackwood. 

3 dice towers.  1 (my collection); 2 (Genesteeler - Bordercon math trade)

v2:  Stringbark 12mm.  Better matching of tower with base, rounded edges on tray, and a better lower ramp.  Also made a 10mm cedar version from some left over timber from Grandparents house. 

4 dice towers.  Stringbark.  2 (my collection); 1 (Mum and Dad&#039;s) / Cedar. 1 (my collection).

v3:  Stringbark 12mm.  rounded edges on tower as well, better finish on varnish.

4 dice towers. 2 (my collection); 2 (this math trade).

As you can see I have a few extras still in my collection that may make future math trades.

To answer specific questions:

[b]Does he sell them?[/b]  Have never really considered it as a commercial venture.  He&#039;s made them because I&#039;ve been interested in them.  I&#039;m quite proud of them so happy to show off his work and offer a few through the Trades (plus, they seem to be good trade bait for games that might otherwise be hard to acquire).

He is happy doing projects for us kids as long as he sees a challenge in it.  Given there&#039;s not too many more areas to tweak the towers, not sure whether too many more will be produced.

Having said that, I might try to improve my own woodworking skills when I visit him so to say no more will be produced is probably inaccurate.

There&#039;s a few other considerations:
- I don&#039;t have a good feeling for the likely demand, although the post seems to have been thumbed quite a few times.
- I don&#039;t have a good gauge for a fair price.  Each Dice Tower probably takes in the vicinity of 3-4 hours to create + cost of the wood. 

[i]TLDR Answer:[/i]  No - though some may be available for trade  sale on ad hoc basis.

[b]Why offered as pair rather than individually?[/b]  This is purely based on my perceptions / expectations.  I generally find that i like to have one at each end of a game to make access easier.  In some cases, I&#039;ve even pulled 4 out for games.  As such, I&#039;ve always offered them up as a pair.

In addition, putting up a pair makes me comfortable to trade for pretty much any other entry on the list.  

Can understand that some people may be perfectly happy with a single tower so maybe I&#039;ll offer one as a single next time.

[b]Feedback[/b]  Would be interested in people&#039;s perception of value,  whether they&#039;d prefer single  set etc.  Please reply or send me a geekmail.

Hi Terry-

I have only seen the pair that were traded at Bordercon last year, so this response is based on a small sample. But I would be confident of $30 for a single tower, as a rock bottom price. Possibly going as high as $40 as a median value. 

The pair is harder to judge: I was thinking from a roleplaying or wargaming perspective where a lone tower would be sufficient... $50-$75?
(I have not included post costs, because they would vary)

:tankard: [i]Time passes, I eat late lunch[/i] :sheep:

I was beset with second thoughts, so did some research. My guesses fit reasonably well with http://www.dicetower.20m.com/ .

VixenTor Games used to make dice towers, but they have closed down. The [url=http://www.vixentorgames.com/deluxe.htm]website [/url] is still up and has pictures.
Their deluxe towers used to be $50US plus post to Australia. MilSims sold them for $64. MS are out of stock, but have plastic ones from Litko for $25 (they look hideous).

I hope that helps.

Rob

PS If your dad is interested in further challenges, what about crokinole boards? Seriously!

They&#039;re lovely!

I love my set.  I&#039;d agree with Rob&#039;s appraisal.  Probably worth at least a good $75 for the set.  I wouldn&#039;t sell mine for under $100.  They are very nicely made.

I&#039;m not finished trading yet - is it possible for me to trade some of my insults for some of Randy&#039;s and then trade the lot for a couple of dice towers?

Thanks for the feedback guys - via replies and via geekmail.

Glad to hear you are enjoying your set Randy.  I think the v3 towers have come quite a way since our initial sets.

I am going to include cash as an option on my trade list for this item, and set the price at $100.

Terry,

Just a thought, mind you.

How about you and your dad get together and make a gazillion (as many as you can) of these little beauties and flog them off next year at CANCON/AGE for $50 each.

Or maybe, Take some orders from the locals (Canberrans) just to test the waters and see how you go.

Like I said just a thought.

Two more centimes :D

	<body>Yeah, it&#039;s pretty much the satsuma of the Maths trade (1:gg: to the first who picks the reference), but if you want it, Fluxx is yours.

Will accept cash $10 shipped or $5 in person at AGE.

[q=&quot;Hida Mann&quot;]Oh man, is there not a Doctor Who fan in the house??[/q]

OK firstly, I cheated and googled it so no geekgold please.

Now, I believe this refers to the episode where the Doctor uses a satsuma in his pocket (or are you just happy to see me?) to save himself from a rabid Sycorax swordsman by throwing it against a button and dropping the Sycorax off the side of the ship.
I only remembered the episode after looking it up - my wife is the rabid Dr Who fan.
Now, your satsuma reference could now mean many things...
1) This game will save your life
2) This game is worth throwing away
3) This game is the only thing you&#039;ll want if you die and regenerate
4) This game is worth throwing at something to get rid of something else (unwanted houseguests perhaps)

OK I give up, spill your guts!

Actually, he has a little speech regarding the satsuma prior to its saving his life.

Google yields exact wording for me:

[i]Not bad for a man in his jim jams. Very Arthur Dent. Now, there was a nice man. Although what have I got in here? A satsuma. Ah, that friend of your mother&#039;s. He does like his snacks, doesn&#039;t he? But doesn&#039;t that just sum up Christmas. You go through all those presents and right at the end tucked away in the bottom there&#039;s always one stupid old satsuma.[/i]

And Fluxx is our Satsuma...

Buy something nice for your wife :) :gg:

	<body>This game, for some reason, is wildly collectable. It&#039;s fun, but not as good as the ebay prices imply, so I guess it should go to a more loving home. My copy is in good condition - there is some wear on the box, but the cards are in good nick and all the dice are there.

Will accept cash $100, will be at AGE.</body>

	<body>Continuing the ACW theme. A simple system and very playable.

This copy is unpunched. AVALON HILL edition.

Description of the game:
Game of the Battle of Shiloh - April 6 and 7, 1862.

Fury in the West is a realistic wargame played on an attractive five color 22 by 28 inch Mapboard with over 230 colorful extra-thick die-cut counters that accurately represent the opposing armies. This game enables you to refight and study one of the least understood battles of the American Civil War.

Fury in the West is one of the most accurate wargames of its kind. Each detail has been pain-stakingly researched in order to achieve strict historical accuracy. The system has been extensively playtested to ensure a fast moving, delicately balanced and exciting game.

Rules cover such important facts as leadership, bayonet charges, gun boats, long range artillery, formations and facing and many more. An innovative yet simple system enables players to record casualties and stragglers of their individual units.</body>

But I didn&#039;t like Pandemic all that much...opps. Why did I buy this?
Played once.

Since this is a cheapish game, I&#039;ll toss in another kids game to sweeten the pot. It&#039;s complete and in good condition.

This is Scotland Yard without all the complicating bits:

I&#039;ve also had many bad monopoly experiences, no offence taken.

My wife works for the dept of environment, so there&#039;s no way she&#039;d let me burn it like that.

But I&#039;ll give it to someone else to burn at AGE for $15... :devil:

Yeah the cannabis smoked in the $5 will make the game tolerable.

	<body>The box is quite scuffed but the contents are complete &amp; in very good condition.  One blank &#039;key&#039; has been written on in pen but I believe that&#039;s what they&#039;re for (there&#039;s another blank one left).

I&#039;ve never played it (received in trade) but some people rate it very highly.

I&#039;ll include a colour printout of the [thing=9365][/thing] rulebook since I won&#039;t need it any more, as well as the updated player aids.

	<body>I have been flip-flopping on whether this will go or not so for the moment it will be up here. I bought it played it a lot, pimped it a bit, but it hasn&#039;t been played in over a year.

This is for the base game in good condition plus the small expansions:
Drakes and Dragonspawn, Traps and Terrors, The Seven Scions, The Cataclysm, The Scepter of Kyros and Walkers of the Wild

It also has glass beads to replace the counters of gems.

If I decide that it goes, I will sell it for $100</body>

Not sure what you mean by &#039;nicks&#039; - the scuffing is pretty noticable on the base game but its structurally sound.  The expansion box is an great condition.

	<body>Interesting game that is the basis for the recent Isla Dorada. There is one ship on the board and all players vote and negotiate to see where it goes. Everyone must reach their secret locations a la TransAmerica. Interesting interplay in the voting mechanic.

This didn&#039;t get a great reception when first released, but there was some problem with the rules, and it is much better with the revised ruleset. 
This copy is German, but the game is more or less language independent. It includes both versions of the rules (not in english) but also a print out of the revised rules in english.

Excellent condition.

I have played this game heaps of times and recently bought my own copy plus a copy of the expansion.

Just confirming - it really sucks - anyone want to play Kingsburg, just let me know.

Which one? The answer is no in both cases.
Its years since I played it, but if I recall correctly, Africa has a board with tokens scattered over it. Player&#039;s ranger figures roam over it collecting tokens. Sets count for something or other... errr....
I might need to look it up on the geek to remember. :-)

Nothing like Medici, except that sometimes it is designed by Reiner Knizia. Medici is a quite pure auction game, Africa is an exploration game with set collection, cunning tile placements, and somewhat light strategy. I received a copy in trade a couple of years ago and have played it 10+ times since then.

[q=&quot;djlg&quot;]Sorry to do this so close to the deadline folks, but I&#039;ll be submitting a null list for this.
I&#039;ve had an offer from a local gaming buddy so I&#039;ll be able to play it again when my future self regrets selling it.[/q]I am standing up, does this account for why list organisers still show you as not having submitted any list for which deadlines close shortly ?

BTW I don&#039;t have access to the maths trade software at work, so I can&#039;t process any more want lists until I get home this evening.

Sorry for being so delightful, so tempting, so wantonly desirable some might say...
Ah, you were talking of the games?

Yes, well, I remember when this Maths Trade was first proposed how some people talked of using it to [b]reduce[/b] their collections. Oh, how I laughed and laughed...

	<body>This is my first maths trade, so please bear with me! Hopefully it really is as simple as it seems.

I&#039;d like to trade away my near-new copy of Ascension. It has only been played once, and is in perfect condition. Hubby is a Dominion devotee, and I can never convince him to play this one over Dominion. 

I won&#039;t be attending AGE. I can deliver in person to LXG or Critical Mass in Brisbane. Otherwise, I&#039;m happy to post it!</body>

Still waiting for one person who asked for an extension. As everyone is being very polite and not deleting items, nothing is messed up by late addition of items. However the deadline this evening is for people to start building their want-lists, so we definitely have to meet that one.

Copies of this out-of-print game used to be readily available; but eventually people caught on to what a cool game it is and the supply became exhausted.  Now, gamers are seeking it out.

Note that even though the picture shows the English edition of this game, I&#039;m actually trading the German edition (which is called Pfeffersacke).  But, again, the game is *entirely* language-independent and I have included an English version of the rules.
