<title>The Australian Mid Year Math Trade 2012</title>
<description>Due to popular demand, here is the next Aussie math trade just in time for BorderCon12 

This Math Trade is brought to you by co-op of

[floatleft][username=Friendless][/floatleft][floatleft][username=prd1982][/floatleft][floatleft][username=batcut][/floatleft][floatleft][username=Amiguero][/floatleft][clear]

Cash option as per the previous Math Trades is available.

The boring bit: 

By posting an item to this list you are agreeing that you can and will mail it anywhere in Australia at your expense. If it looks like that&#039;s going to cost a lot, make sure you don&#039;t trade it for something crap.

There will be [b]NO removal of entries possible[/b] as this made it difficult for some people to track items.

More details about the cash bids look here

[b][size=18]Specific Rules:[/size][/b]

:star: This trade is open to Australian BGGers only.

:star: This trade is open to board games, expansions, card games, game accessories, RPG, video games and the like. Please don&#039;t add anything else. If you intend to allow a game to be exchanged for cash (i.e. you&#039;re selling), please include the amount you will accept for it in the price. You may consider compare current market prices (ebay, BGG, local shop) 

:star: In ALL cases, [b]SENDER PAYS SHIPPING[/b]. Even if you&#039;re selling a game for cash, [b]SENDER PAYS SHIPPING[/b]. Even to Perth or Townsville or Hobart. So, make sure you set your price high enough that you would be happy to pay shipping to anywhere else in Australia out of that money. 

:star: Consider the Australian Post option of flat-rate box previously suggested. More details [url=http://auspost.ebay.com.au/flat-rate-box?clk_rvr_id=288654101739]here[/url].  

:star: There is an expectation for items included in the math trade to remain as part of the math trade until the closing date. If your intention is to sell an item there are other alternatives in BGG to do so. If an item is not longer available for whatever reason, please indicate so with big letters.    

[b]Note[/b]: BGG runs a marketplace where sellers pay 3% commission to BGG, and I recommend that this should apply here as well. As Aldie&#039;s debt-collectors don&#039;t get over this way very much, I suggest that sellers make a donation of that 3% using the standard BGG donation system.

:star: Traders will not be required to add cash items to the geeklist - that will be handled in the want lists. In the case that a buyer offers more than a seller is asking, the buyer will pay the seller&#039;s price. Sorry sellers, this is not an auction, this is a maths trade, and you only get as much as you ask for.

:star: Australian BGGers can participate even without submitting an item to the trade with the cash option by submitting want list as indicated below.

[b]Limits:[/b]

Feel free to put as many items on the list as you want. Duplicates of items already on the list are okay. You can combine multiple games into one item (e.g. Alhambra  plus expansions).

Describe the edition, language, and condition of the game. Pick a picture that represents the game you&#039;re offering if there are multiple versions. If necessary, take a picture of the game, upload it to your gallery, and use that image.

Feel free to use the rating suggested by petegs to describe your items:

[b]New in shrink[/b] - which means never opened.
[b]Opened but unpunched[/b] - I&#039;ve looked at the game but not punched counters yet or stickered blocks etc.
[b]Opened and punched[/b] - Looked at, even punched counters etc but haven&#039;t played.
[b]Opened and played[/b].

Count pieces to make sure the games are complete, and accurately list any components that are missing or damaged. Please look at your trade pile to make sure the game is really there.

In order to make your items more (or less) appealing, you may want to add one or more &quot;sweeteners&quot; to the item listing -- an expansion, a related game, or a completely unrelated item that you think will make it a more desirable package.

Items for which there is no BGG listing can be listed as Miscellaneous Game Accessory.

[b]Algorithm:[/b]

Trade lists will be found by TradeMaximizer using SCALED-PRIORITIES, ALLOW-DUMMIES, REQUIRE-COLONS and REQUIRE-USERNAMES switches. The actual code is a heavily modified version of Trade Maximiser 1.3a, modified to allow geeklist integration (as we&#039;ve been using in Australia for a couple of years) and now the cash bids. The (Java) source code will be available to anyone who&#039;s interested.

There really is no leeway for that, as people may need to get their games to a willing &#039;games mule&#039; attending BorderCon.

[i]Packing tips:[/i]
- Make sure the game contents are secure [i]inside[/i]the game and won&#039;t shift around.
- Place the game in a plastic bag to prevent water damage (in the event it is left out in the rain).
- Make sure there&#039;s cushioning around all side of the game.
- Use a proper box. (Auspost &quot;ToughBags&quot; won&#039;t prevent crushing.)
- Make sure the box is properly taped up.
- Make sure the address is clear and won&#039;t get torn off. 

I suggest follow the recommendations above even if you are not posting your items and using a &#039;game mule&#039;.

[b]Want List Format:[/b]

The official item list will be of a format something like:
0001-TWIXT
0002-BMOON
0003-PUERT
0004-TICHU

Want lists must be submitted in a format like

([i]your user name[/i]-batcut) 0001-TWIXT : 0004-TICHU 0002-BMOON

indicating that batcut, the person who put item 0001, a Twixt game, into the list would be willing to accept either item 0004, a Tichu game, or item 0002, Blue Moon, in trade for it. The order of listing is your order of preference, in case both trades are possible.

The order of wants is a tiebreaker only. The system will first try to maximise the number of trades, even if this means that you get your last preference. The order of your wants will only be considered if there are multiple ways to get the maximum trades. But, fear not! You will never get a game that is not on your want list.

If you put 5 games on this trade list, you will be submitting 5 different want lists.

You may also submit want lists for cash bids. In that case, you write something like this:

([i]your user name[/i]-batcut) $20 : 0004-TICHU 0002-BMOON

meaning that batcut has $20 and he&#039;ll pay it for either Tichu or Blue Moon. You could also write this:

([i]your user name[/i]-batcut) $10 : 0004-TICHU
([i]your user name[/i]-batcut) $20 : 0002-BMOON

meaning that batcut will pay $10 for Tichu and $20 for Blue Moon, so batcut could be up for $30 total. To ensure that you don&#039;t spend all of your beer money, you can add a spending limit just like this:

([i]your user name[/i]-batcut) LIMIT : $30

which means that no matter what happens, batcut won&#039;t win trades such that he has to spend more than $30. I&#039;ll tell you how that works. We run the trade algorithm, and inspect the results. If anyone has exceeded their spending limit, their highest-priced successful bid is removed and the algorithm is re-run. Continue until all spending limits are satisfied. If you don&#039;t specify a spending limit, the program infers a limit which is the highest amount you&#039;ve been for any single item. That will be a rather conservative limit, but follows the maxim of no nasty surprises.

To sell a game, you can submit a trade list like this:

([i]your user name[/i]-batcut) 0001-TWIXT : 0004-TICHU 0002-BMOON $30

meaning that for Twixt batcut will accept Tichu, or Blue Moon, or $30 from anyone who&#039;s offering cash.

Finally, do not try to screw the system. The program will reject nonsense like this:

(batcut) $10: $20
(batcut) %CASH: $20
(batcut) $10: %CASH
(batcut) $20: $10

and furthermore John reserves the right to change the program to reject anything else he sees as a scam and not an honest trade. Please post any questions in the Geeklist Comments below.

Finally, please let know others that the math trade is up and running.

[b]I don&#039;t see any difference.[/b] If it is because Math is US jargon that is not in itself a reason. I embrace US spellings such as color and harbor as being more logical.

Not to go terribly off topic but &#039;maths&#039; is the accepted term in Australia. American spellings like &#039;color&#039; and &#039;harbor&#039; are technically acceptable here, they are just generally not used.

It&#039;s mostly personal preference, but I for one relish the few remaining parts of identity that we&#039;re allowed to hold on to without feeling a need to imitate other countries.

Furthermore, since when has logic ever had anything to do with the Australian/English language?

Hi Everybody...

Just thought I better pop back in and apologise (or is that apologize)? I didn&#039;t mean to start a language debate or anything I just have this thing with the word lego vs legos...

Sorry if I&#039;ve gotten anybody&#039;s back up about language. As you probably know, by my spelling in my posts, language is not really my strong point. 

I was just trying to have some light hearted fun and highlight that we do allow other game platforms in our trade.

sorry again. 

yours humbly,

Damo.

Damo,

don&#039;t apologize - it&#039;s not a debate - several people have echoed the comment math/maths - or you are echoning their comment - I am genuinely curious - it seems to me to be mere semantics - but if there is more to it than that I am curious - I am an information sponge - fill me up!

Note that the flat-rate boxes are still available as well: $6.50 for Bx1 (code 00069), $10.50 for Bx2 (code 00076) and $13.25 for the Bx4 (code 00090).  Unless you already have some, you have to buy the box as well; and you have to pay online via Click-and-Send, then take it to a post office for lodgement.  But $13.25 for 15kg to Perth from the east coast, including tracking, is pretty good too :D

Link is [url]http://auspost.ebay.com.au[/url] (the front page there now talks about smaller flat-rate satchels than James discusses above, namely $6.20 for 500g and $10.55 for 3kg, plus the satchels themselves), but once you register for Click-and-Send you can access the box info too.

Regards,

David.

[q=&quot;da pyrate&quot;]A serious question - why?[/q]
Because we are Australians (visitors, residents and citizens) discussing a trade [i]in Australia[/i]. The word in Australian English is [i]Maths[/i]. If the language ever transforms to the extent that &quot;Math&quot; is predominant, then that is what will be used, naturally.

In the meantime, its use on this list is odd. It isn&#039;t that &quot;Math&quot; makes understanding difficult: it is simply out of place. Arguably we should champion our cultural differences too- not because Australian culture is superior* (!), but because [i]difference is interesting[/i], it adds depth and texture to life.

Undeniably the word in Maths in Australian English, but I would be interested to learn the etymology of the phrase &quot;Math Trade&quot;.

If the phrase was first coined in the US then one could argue that the &quot;correct&quot; usage is &quot;Math Trade&quot; and not &quot;Maths Trade&quot;, respecting its origin.  

I don&#039;t really care either way. Kudos to the organisers of the Australian Algorithm Trade for taking to time and energy to put this together again.  Its always fun!

[q=&quot;jamesmckane&quot;]Hey everyone, I just thought I&#039;d link to a [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/789111/postage-information-for-australians-might-be-help]recent post of mine[/url] that may help those here having to post games. There is a new Australia Post satchel that I think I&#039;ll be using from now on to send games in the future:). [/q]

I obviously cannot speak for everyone James, but I would be very annoyed to have a game shipped to me in a satchel rather than a box, so that it is almost guaranteed to suffer some form of ding/dent damage.

As a trader I take a fair amount of time and effort to pack games to the best of my ability, and the pride I have in the knowledge that I have done the best I possibly can to get the game to the receiver in exactly the same condition it left is worth more than the dollar or two more it might cost to put in a box.

The point is valid and the satchel may not be appropriate for all games (depending on size) but there&#039;s no reason you can&#039;t box it and then chuck it in the satchel.  Just think of the satchel as a reeeeally big postage stamp that covers the whole box.

[q=&quot;ausminstrel&quot;][q=&quot;jamesmckane&quot;]Hey everyone, I just thought I&#039;d link to a [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/789111/postage-information-for-australians-might-be-help]recent post of mine[/url] that may help those here having to post games. There is a new Australia Post satchel that I think I&#039;ll be using from now on to send games in the future:). [/q]

I obviously cannot speak for everyone James, but I would be very annoyed to have a game shipped to me in a satchel rather than a box, so that it is almost guaranteed to suffer some form of ding/dent damage.

As a trader I take a fair amount of time and effort to pack games to the best of my ability, and the pride I have in the knowledge that I have done the best I possibly can to get the game to the receiver in exactly the same condition it left is worth more than the dollar or two more it might cost to put in a box.[/q]
[b]I have a request for anyone who is considering mailing in a satchel:[/b]

[i]Please[/i] indicate this in your game listing on the trade. Seriously - I want to know that in advance.

But it&#039;s easy to get bubble wrap really cheap and get cardboard for free and wrap the game box in that, and then send it off in a satchel. You&#039;ll get cardboard for free from any grog shop and bubblewrap from Austraila Post or Officeworks for a couple of dollars and it&#039;ll be enough to wrap a few games. [/q]Just because you pack it with bubble wrap and &quot;cardboard for free&quot; does not mean that will reduce the possibility of crushing in transit. IMHO speaking from experience with these postpak boxes, they are new and sturdy, filling residual space with beans will result in hassle free transport.

[q=&quot;Ykikamucow&quot;]Hi Everybody...

Just thought I better pop back in and apologise (or is that apologize)? I didn&#039;t mean to start a language debate or anything I just have this thing with the word lego vs legos...

Sorry if I&#039;ve gotten anybody&#039;s back up about language. As you probably know, by my spelling in my posts, language is not really my strong point. 

I was just trying to have some light hearted fun and highlight that we do allow other game platforms in our trade.

sorry again. 

yours humbly,

Damo.[/q]

Hey all,

I only just noticed this conversation going on as a result of my Math/Maths post. I too want to aplogise. It wasn&#039;t by any means a serious suggestion! (hence the ;) :p)

Although, that last one won&#039;t be doing anything useful[1] until we allocate (and I get) codes for all the games. I&#039;ll update it to mention that at some point.

At that point you will be able to select items. The tool is designed to build a list, though can only build a list if it has codes.

Yeah, it&#039;s looking for the maths trade codes before it allows any selections. This was because the last trade had so many withdrawn items. I&#039;ve been flat out lately, so I haven&#039;t had a chance to do an update. I&#039;ll look into the problem with your wish/want list, Tegs. It might be that the data has been cached and it&#039;s showing you old info, so I could add a cache flush option.

I&#039;m also going to experiment with the maths trade code generator I was talking about last time. That should save the organisers some effort and allow selection ahead of time. Let&#039;s see how much time I can put into it before 20th May :)

No worries! I hadn&#039;t realised the selection tool only activates after the list is finalised. Thanks for the explaination. The wishlist thing is no big deal, I know what games I want :D

[q=&quot;dlow&quot;]Note that the flat-rate boxes are still available as well: $6.50 for Bx1 (code 00069), $10.50 for Bx2 (code 00076) and $13.25 for the Bx4 (code 00090).  Unless you already have some, you have to buy the box as well; and you have to pay online via Click-and-Send, then take it to a post office for lodgement.  But $13.25 for 15kg to Perth from the east coast, including tracking, is pretty good too :D

Link is [url]http://auspost.ebay.com.au[/url] (the front page there now talks about smaller flat-rate satchels than James discusses above, namely $6.20 for 500g and $10.55 for 3kg, plus the satchels themselves), but once you register for Click-and-Send you can access the box info too.

Regards,

David.

Has anyone here actually used &#039;click-and-send&#039;? I have registered for it and found it incomprehensible. 

In an email from Australia Post they actually say &quot;We have many issues currently with Click and Send which could be causing some confusion on the website making the process tedious rather than simple.&quot;

Comments?

Being from WA I&#039;ve used click and send almost exclusively (recycling old boxes are fun too)

The idea is you put in all the details online and pay for it online, print out the label and drop it off at post office.

Yea the website is a bit tedious to use but once it&#039;s figured out it&#039;s generally pretty straight forward for the flat rate box.  The most annoying thing I found is that they don&#039;t keep a record of any &#039;purchases&#039; so I generally save a pdf copy for references.  I havn&#039;t had any complaints yet about my packages so it&#039;s ok.

But the website is useless if you want to cut queue and print off the label beforehand and pay later (anything non-flat rate), because the software between the website and post office must be incompatible or something, and they just go through the whole process again at the post office anyway.  It&#039;s meant to save processing time but it took me two days last time to sort out the discrepancies.

The other thing is that the post office staffs generally had no previous experiences with click and send so that slow things down a bit, but after going to the same office a few times they generally know what to do now.

Used it, enjoyed it :D  But I haven&#039;t tried to play anything other than the standard &quot;pay online, print label, deposit box at post office&quot; game.

I did get an EMail or two recently from them saying that they were migrating to a new system in late April.  The last thing I did was on the old system, so there might be differences now...

I&#039;ve written a function to generate maths trade codes and I&#039;m working on a couple of other bits and pieces as well. I hope to incorporate them into the tools before the end of the week. With any luck, I can figure out a way to post the codes to the list as comments.

Okeydokey... I&#039;ve hacked the trade code generator function into the old list only view:

:d6-2: [url=http://zincgames.com/sandpit/bgg-gl-list.php?glid=140281][COLOR=#0033FF][b][size=18]GL List Only[/size][/b][/COLOR][/url] gives a list of all items on one page along with checkboxes to quickly highlight stuff you&#039;re interested in.

In addition to doing some guesswork based on the number of words in the item&#039;s title, it will also look for a code. The code is the same format used by JeffyJeff&#039;s OLWLG (I figured there&#039;s no reason we can&#039;t have compatibility if needed), and the format is as follows:

[c]+altname+ Reality Always Needs Dimpled Yaks -altname-[/c]
[i]If this was the 123rd game on the list, its code would be 0123-RANDY[/i]

Anything between the [c]+altname+[/c] and the [c]-altname-[/c] is used to generate the trade code instead of the original name. For example, last trade we had some NDS games that had no entries. This option allows them to have a meaningful name in the GL List.

[COLOR=#CC0000][b]Disclaimer: Do not take these generated codes to be the final ones! I&#039;m putting this up for discussion as an option and they are likely to change, especially with people playing with the altnames![/b][/COLOR]

Geekmail me if anything breaks as I won&#039;t have much time to check back here on the geeklist in the next couple of days.

Just think of the fun in generating all those [b]0123-RANDY[/b] codes and the like. I did notice both PitchCar Expansions ([listitem=2104235]082[/listitem] &amp; [listitem=2104237]083[/listitem]) had the same code.

It still needs some tweaking. For example, I&#039;m being a bit lazy in shortening words like &#039;A&#039; &amp; &#039;The&#039; by doing a quick check for the word having 3 or fewer letters. This produces ugly codes like [c]0049-DXXXX[/c]... so I&#039;ll fix that if this is considered usable :)

The PitchCar naming shouldn&#039;t be too much of an issue since they still have the identifying number.

Enter these separately: nnnn-GONE or nnnn-SOLD or nnnn-NLA (No Longer Available), where nnnn = the geeklist item number.

I had to add one for RAF - entered as 0234-NOTAV.

I was thinking more along the more programmatic lines of:

+altname+ WITHDRAWN -altname-

I can then check for that and disable the item, or hide it. Do you reckon you could add that in for RAF so I can test it?

EDIT: Ah, I see... I didn&#039;t realise you were already adding the codes in. Hmm... that might mean that I have to go back to my old hacky way of parsing the comments to make sure I have the exact codes.

Purely as a matter of interest, and even though some people would object, putting the list in alphabetical order just prior to adding codes would put all games with the same title next to each other - this would make it easier to seclect when there are multiple copies available and more consistent with the codes.

I love alphabetical order - I even put numbers in alphabetical order.

[q=&quot;The great English poet, Les Barker (who often tours Australia)&quot;]

[u] Chronology [/u]

No, this is the very last line

I didn’t know I was doing it.
I did it unthinking it for years.
It isn’t until you look back,
From a distance, a pattern appears

I did everything in chronological order.
You don’t see at the time, you’re immersed,
But all of the things, I did later in life,
Were done after the things I did first.

It’s all in chronological order.
It’s frustrating, I get really vexed.
I’d like to do something sooner or later,
But everything comes out as next

I’d like to do the next thing I do
Before something that’s already done,
Or maybe finish a job
A week before it’s begun

Then I’d be free as the birds.
Then I’d be free of this curse.
And this didn’t finish the verse
If this line didn’t come first?

There, I broke the bonds of time
I shall treasure that brief second when
For a moment my then stood alongside your now
But my now was long gone with your then

I used to do things in chronological order
But that’s not the case anymore
Before just came after after
After before before

Each moment was set by convention
A link in a chain hereby broken
You can now hear each word that I say
But in they’re not order the spoken

Eight o’clock, Eleven, Five, Four, Nine, One,
My mind is constrained by no border
Seven o’clock, six, ten, three, twelve, two
I count time in alphabetical order

Make April the start of your year,
And Wednesday the end of your week,
Listen when you want to hear, 
Don’t wait till somebody speaks

Don’t live your life strictly in sequence
Don’t march to the chime of time’s bell
Don’t wait till today to take action
Make yesterday the day you rebel

Life’s fuller when time is fragmented
When the sequence of history varies
It’s easy to face Armageddon
When it’s followed by a week in the Canaries

No more chronological order
I move round my day by design
This is not the last line of the poem
[/q]

By &#039;errors&#039;, do you mean anything that deviates from my automatically generated item codes? Since we don&#039;t have a standardised way of identifying withdrawn items (I&#039;d like it if folks added +altname+ WITHDRAWN -altname- to the main item description), I&#039;ll have to do some hacky stuff to read through the comments anyway. I&#039;ll see if I can write something to verify the codes here while I&#039;m at it.

[b]A quick note to those adding sweeteners: You need to link the the item, not just show a picture, if you want the old and forthcoming trade tools to pick up on them.[/b]

More if I put the wrong item number in the code, e.g.GL item is 121 Dixit and and I put 0112-DIXIT, or for the same game used different codes, e.g.for The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game I used TLOTR and LRTCG.

The pattern that has existed for the last couple of years has been one mid-year (prior to BorderCon) and one at the end of the year (prior to CanCon).  The last one was Dec 11 - it had more items than this one (over 1,000).  The one before that was April 11 (it had less items).

This, I do not know. Someone has the master list that&#039;s going to be fed into the trade and I&quot;m hoping the codes I have form that list, otherwise people will be verifying wrongly.

Checking, it looks as if my list of codes does not reflect reality completely. (For example 0645). Can I get the real list?

Yep, I was wondering if some codes had changed since I made the list and it appears they have. I&#039;ll get you the new one this evening. No more changing codes please!

Very well, I have no choice. For a limited time only, I am offering a [b]FULL REFUND!![/b] on all money paid to me for the use of my wantlist verification tool this maths trade, until the codes can be cleared up.

Item 0645 was a double post of the previous item. There is only one game available that is why I asked the code to be changed. 

Also, note that the deadline for the final list is today 10 pm.

To make it effective I&#039;ll close the MT now and further discussion on the thread for the MT in the link in the header or look for it in the Aus Victoria forum.

[q=&quot;tiggers&quot;]Is it as good as the movie?[/q]
It&#039;s an an interesting co-op heist with great components. The main problem is that the rules are awful and the small amount of text on components is in Italian -- so, it&#039;s about as good as a decent Lupin III movie that&#039;s been incredibly badly dubbed into English and then helpfully subtitled in Italian.

I&#039;m sorry to see Amiguero let his copy go because I think it would be better on the second play and I want to try it again! :shake:

(P.S. &quot;The&quot; movie? Including the 20+ feature-length made-for-TV specials, there are actually around thirty Lupin movies. If you&#039;ve only seen The Castle of Cagliostro and are inclined to try more, I think [url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0827737/]Lupin III: Episode 0 - First Contact[/url] is a good place to start -- a prequel about how the gang and Zenigata all meet.)

Easy game for kids to pick up if you like the family games.

my 10, 9 &amp; 6 year old played it well. I think in the last game my 10 &amp; 6 year olds conspired to beat me.

Will not be at Bordercon, Can find a Mule

Added Cash Trade $15.</body>

	<body>All Components checked and bagged, components in near perfect condition.

The box on the other hand, has a split along one base edge, (it&#039;s just the outer layer and doesn&#039;t break), there is also a minor crease in the base of the box looks like at some stage it was picked up with one hand and either squezed or bent due to its weight. Some other minor marks, looks to be shelf wear and one edge of the box lid, along a corner does not look to be sealed properly. 

I&#039;m sorry about the condition of the box and pictures can be supplied if anyone want&#039;s to have a closer look at any of the damage. Most damage can&#039;t be seen when the box is sitting flat but full disclosure is important in these things!

Probably not at BorderCon.

Not sure if I am going to let this one go or not, so if this is a &quot;high priority&quot; on the trade for you, please contact me to see which way I am leaning towards. 

(It&#039;s included here because I thought it would be easier to keep track of my items if they were all in one place.)

Edit: I will be submitting a want list for this, so please include it in your want lists! The expansion is in the box, I don&#039;t have it separated out.</body>

I think it&#039;s the Australian edition (1998). Box is worn but components seem to be in great shape.  Don&#039;t think it got much play.

Condition: received last maths trade.  Unplayed by me.  Bits in great condition.

EDIT: forgot to mention this is in German (I&#039;ve changed the image to reflect this).  I&#039;ll include a print out of the rules in English.  The game itself is language independant.</body>

Think of your children, you know they want to play with the trap and we could do with the extra shelf space!

Used and played, but still in perfect working order.

You could probably add a 3rd item if you want, combining the two, then only trade this separate items if the combine items trade (at least I think you can do this via the want algorithm).

	<body>Picked this up second-hand earlier this year, but not my sort of thing.

Based on the components list, all the boards etc. are there, plus all 32 miniatures, unpainted -- and four unrelated metal space orks, 2 painted -- but it is missing 1 football, 2 of the d6en and the handbook (not required for play; the rulebook is there). The box has some splitting on the corners but is otherwise in pretty good nick. The previous owner added black lines between the spaces on the sweet [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/image/160368/blood-bowl-second-edition]&quot;astrogranite&quot; pitch[/url].

[b]ALSO INCLUDES[/b] [thing=2286][/thing]. I can&#039;t find a list of components at all, so I&#039;m not sure if any of the tokens it may or may not have come with are missing. There are 48 star player cards which I think is all of them.

I expect to be at BorderCon.</body>

	<body>Last maths trade I included several batches of 2-3 PS2 games and none of them traded. This time I&#039;m including all of the games together as one item – perhaps they&#039;ll go. I promise not to include them next time if they don&#039;t! All are PAL versions in good condition, including discs, cases and manuals, except where indicated.

	<body>Similarly, the smaller batches of Xbox games I included last time didn&#039;t trade, so I&#039;ll see what happens putting them together into one batch. All are PAL versions in good condition, including discs, cases and manuals, except where indicated.

But I&#039;ll also throw in:

[thing=14736][/thing]  [ImageID=974428] - the first edition. The cards are in good condition, the plastic box is cracked.

	<body>Game pictured - Game itself has only been played once, is in good condition and complete.  There is some scuffing on the box due to moving (for example around the bottom right of the pyramid) and the box also bulges as the stack of cards is slightly higher than the sides.  Not sure if there was ever an insert in the box, but if so, it&#039;s not there any longer.

Also includes:

[b]In the same box[/b] (that means there is no camelot legends box, both games are in the Illuminati box, another casualty of moving).

Again played once, in good condition.  Some slight wear on one of the player aids which was topmost with the cards on top of it, now flipped over to avoid this.</body>

(Carabande is the first edition of PitchCar: generally regarded as having higher-quality components, but not compatible with PitchCar track pieces.)

Boxes show some shelf wear; one corner of the Carabande box is split. Missing instructions, score pad and 3 of the 8 car discs (one blue, one green and one yellow). I have put in some spare Crokinole discs as substitutes. Otherwise in great condition.

Happy for trade or sale; I will be at BorderCon.</body>

	<body>This is the original version of this game - the one with Saddam Hussein on the cover.

The box is a little beat up, but not at all bad for a 25-year-old game.

There is a minor board rip. It&#039;s there and obvious, but it is cosmetic damage only, really.

It&#039;s missing one die (a d8) - again, this is a minor issue as it still has 3 d8s anyway.

There is indeed one US Infantry piece missing, but as mentioned above, this is easily solvable.

A couple of other infantry pieces are a little &#039;weak in the knees&#039;...

There is also a bag of surplus pieces for the invaders, so you have replacements if you lose something.

Bordercon?  I can&#039;t handle the Bordercon!  So I won&#039;t be there.</body>

	<body>2010/2011 Edition.
In great condition - The cards have been sleeved and the other components are intact. 

This is NOT the newest edition. Check out the Castelli review on this game to see the components.

	<body>In great condition - I put some sticky tapes on the edges of the character cards as the new clips I received from Avalon Hill could damage the cards (Too tight!). [-]I will put some photos up as soon as I get a chance.

May not look so pretty but the clips slide well and don&#039;t come off as easily :)


Also received from Avalon Hill the new map tiles and tokens which don&#039;t warp. 

I removed the insert so I could leave the old components (mostly warped) in the box just in case. 

The other components, including event cards, figures, etc. are intact. 

I won&#039;t be at Border Con but I will see if I can find somebody who will be there..!

A great gateway game for children. Various small games in one box; quiz, drawing, acting, etc.

A great little solo game covering the East Front in WWII, I&#039;m surprised you&#039;re parting with it Pete.

The player controls the Axis forces trying to destroy Russia before they can build up their forces. The &#039;game&#039; plays Russia, managing the retreat and eventually the Russian counter-attack (ie: the rules provide details on how the Russians retreat and attack).

In case you were wondering, I won&#039;t be at Bordercon.

I believe that this is the first edition, as it&#039;s the multi-lingual version.  It has the &#039;Plot Thickens&#039; expansion included.

Little bit of shelf-ware on the box.</body>

1st or 2nd Edition?

I am not 100% sure - the box doesn&#039;t mention edition at all. Comparing http://tinyurl.com/hamv1 and http://www.funagain.com/control/product?product_id=013548, the box looks to be the latter (second edition) - mainly in terms of the logo in the bottom right, and the image on the back of the box.

Is there any other way to identify 1st vs 2nd version?

Well, yes that, or you could use it to verify wantlists for the last maths trade. Either works :)

Until I get The Official List, I can&#039;t update the verifier. It would be probably be counterproductive to verify want-lists against an [i]almost[/i] correct list.

Mr Brown always looks after his games very well. 

Speaking of which - finally getting into Puzzle Strike. Julian and I recently had an epic game that went for about an hour after we knocked Nick out. It came down to who fell asleep first (as game went for close to TWO FRIGGIN HOURS and we finshed at 2am).

Why is this relevant. Well the copy of Puzzle Strike was once Mr Brown&#039;s, and was in excellent condition :p

This is a great game, light-medium, true euro, I got mine in last maths trade and do not regret it. Plays well for 4 players and easy to teach new players. A great game to kick off games meet when waiting for people.

[thing=823][/thing] is basically [thing=37111][/thing] WITHOUT the traitor. Still good, but slightly flavourless.[/q]

In my opinion it is a truly excellent introduction into cooperative gaming. It does not feature a traitor or have the game overtly try to screw you, so it is well suited to family play. It can be taught in 5 minutes and would be easily understood by children from about 8 up (and grandparents!), and it plays in less than an hour.

I agree that its simpler mechanics may not make it as enticing to &quot;experienced&quot; gamers, but it is always on my short-list of possible choices to induct newbies, and is a thoroughly recommended stepping stone to the more challenging implications of [thing=15062][/thing] and [thing=37111][/thing].

Yep.  I never had it but seeing other friends&#039; copy it would have been taken out to fit dixit 2.

I agree it is a fantastic game, the only things I don&#039;t like are the turn order and the catch up mechanics, and it bothers me enough that I&#039;m not sure if I&#039;ll play it too much, someone else can benefit from it.

When I played it (it was in preproduction at that stage) I didn&#039;t notice any catch up mechanics. My impression (and that of a few other BGGers based on their game comments) is the opposite - that the game suffers from runaway loser problems. If bash the leader - which can be achieved in spades - is the catch up mechanic then I agree. What are the catch up mechanics that help someone who gets off to a bad start though?

EDIT: After checking I realise the French can help a player who is low on points but nothing can help a player who makes the fatal error of going for points early and loses their income. Nothing.

The Assistance from the French, someone did suggest it was a French letter, whilst up to 25 income once only only helps when the leader is thoroughly stomped on.Sadly, I still haven&#039;t worked out how to go under the radar on this one and so I am on the receiving end.

That&#039;s what I meant.  The turn order as I remember always benefit the leader and while the French is very powerful it&#039;s a one time thing, and require a bit of forethought/planning.  In fact, I won my first game by timing my French aid perfectly.

But it does have lots of interesting strategies. E.g. great theme and some great mechanics, the open information/secret bidding makes the game fun and tense which lots of opportunity for deal-making/breaking and bluffing.

[b]NOTE[/b]:
I&#039;ve replaced the wooden cubes (legions) with plastic minis (from Conquest of the Empire) and poker chips, which I think is much nicer. Notice that I said [u][i]replaced[/i][/u]: the 60 brown wooden cubes are missing. Here&#039;s a pic, to see what I mean:

$30 is a bargain for this game.  It&#039;s $85 at GP online.  If I didn&#039;t already have it I&#039;d be all over this.

Likewise. Mind you, that&#039;s true for a lot of the games here, which is probably why the &#039;if I didn&#039;t already have it&#039; crops up so much :D

You should have seen the bargains Kerrin was offering at Billabong last night. Alhambra Big Box $20, Gates of Loyang $20, Cities $10, Friday $5 etc.

The one night my daughter demanded I stay and taste the chocolate cake she was baking, so I missed out. :angry:

Power grid 20, power grid maps &amp; box 20, carc h&amp;g 10,  the list goes on... 

But it was a good way of clearing shelves. I&#039;m a bit inspired by it.

At the end of Essen, I punched &amp; bagged the games so I could fit them in my luggage &amp; packed the empty boxes into a separate carton. The shippers didn&#039;t put the carton of empty boxes onto the pallet. I feel however, that demo games are more effective witha box to go with them, so I&#039;ll open another as a demo one if these copies trade/sell.

	<body>Boxless version in shrink.

I&#039;m in the middle of a scenario from this and can attest to it being a great game. I got an extra unboxed one when I bought mine. You can buy a very nice box from the publisher now for about US$6 + shipping

	<body>Boxless version in shrink

I&#039;m in the middle of a PBEM scenario of this and I am having a ball, so much so that I bought some more supplements recently

I bought an extra boxless version when I got mine,

Not sure why I bought more supplements as this has 112 scenarios - enough to last for quite a while

	<body>New in Shrink.

I quite like this series, but I don&#039;t play the other ones I have enough to justify opening this one.

Its a cool system where you give written orders to your subordinates who may (or may not) do what you want when you want. A great way to simulate the problems of battles at the time

[b]NOTE:[/b] These are the original releases, so 1 copy of each card in Kings of the Sea + Greyjoy resin house card and 2 copies of each card in Princes of the Sun.
[ImageID=578932]

Boxes opened, but cards still in shrink.

Special Bonus:
If you want it, you can also have the spare stuff I don&#039;t need from [thing=39953][/thing] core set.
This would be: board, all tokens, title miniatures and cards, house cards, rules and possibly some spare basic locations/attachments.
Also if desired, a copy of every plot card and agenda from the other 4 deluxe expansions and from the chapter pack cycles Brotherhood without Banners, Secrets of Oldtown &amp; A Tale of Champions (approx. 9 agendas and 46ish plots).

Q: Is this enough to play 2 player to see if i like the game?
A: Yes, particularly if you cut the decks down from 60 cards (the core set uses decks of 35 cards).

	<body>Box pretty beaten up, especially the lid.
There&#039;s a crease in one corner of the rules book, and some minor stains on one page.
Some wear on the counters wear they fit into the plastic stands.
Slight tears in the map along the fold seams.

Photos to be put up soon.

Everything present except:
1d10 - black if I remember correctly.  Can add one in if desired. :)
[i]Possibly [/i]1 Facehugger counter (seems to be conflicting reports over whether there should be 3 or 4).  Note: Facehuggers are not used in any of the scenarios.

Hi Jason

Andrew&#039;s out of town so not sure if/when he will be able to reply.

I can confirm the one for trade is the Avalon Hill pictured version.

	<body>Head-to-head table shuffleboard with magnetic discs for crazy curve shots. Fun, but I have plenty of other flicking games and can&#039;t justify the space this one is taking up. Excellent condition -- one play session of ~5 rounds. No photos on BGG, but Milsims [url=http://www.milsims.com.au/node/121857]has a picture of the box[/url] which tells the whole story.

Trade or cash (probably $15 in the trade to cover possible postage, early offers for less accepted if you can pick up at Bordercon).</body>

	<body>My copy is pictured.  Box is damaged (see picture) and generally worn, and the cards are black bordered on the front (bad design choice guys) and showing their wear from repeated plays (Here is the worst example I could find):

[ImageID=1317555]

Otherwise game components are in good condition and complete (rule book, cards and die all present).  Anyway here is a picture from when I counted the cards:

I don&#039;t think there were any, but just in case, there is no insert or other non-game components in the box.

Neither of the expansions have their own box -- they&#039;re in with the main games.
I think there might be a small biro mark on the rules for the Red Killer Bunnies expansion.
All in good condition because they&#039;ve hardly been played. I seem to recall that I printed out and mounted some player mats for Munchkin. Don&#039;t quote me on that, but treat it as a bonus if they&#039;re in there :P

	<body>German edition, comes with rules in German and English. Please note: 

[b]While this copy is perfectly playable, it has sustained some serious damage![/b]

Box lid and bottom (including cardboard insert) have been crushed badly, and some large rips have been repaired with tape. 

One of the egg-shaped track tiles is creased.

The yellow chicken has a 1.5cm crack at the back.

Edit: Let me know if you&#039;d like me to send you some photos showing the damage.

Open to offers.

	<body>Finally got to play this and discovered that it was way to similar to one of my own designs to keep it :)

GM me if you really need to know which ducks are in the box.

First edition: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgameversion/25327/first-edition-6p

Condition:
The box has some light dishing due to the over zealous shrink wrapping this version had. Otherwise, it&#039;s excellent having been played only once.

	<body>Pictured black box edition, I am sure if you look this up on ebay somebody will say it is uber-rare.  This is quite possibly not true although I didn&#039;t notice another copy of this on the trade list yet, so maybe it is or the other copies are just being tightly held :p

Regardless of the above this copy is the only available in this item of the geeklist and it is in shrink.

	<body>Game is in great condition. The box is a bit scuffed (as have been all the copies I&#039;ve seen of this).

The one with the bridge (where one of gets to say &quot;You shall not pass&quot; all game long).
Played once.  Game in excellent condition.  Box has dent in one corner.

Won&#039;t be at BorderCon, will be at TAGE.

Are the two codes for the one item going to make any problems for the algorithm?

- Edited this in light of what Sol said below with quoting codes compounding the problem.

Are the two codes for the one item going to make any problems for the algorithm?[/q]With deference to that song of eras gone by:
Two [-]men[/-] codes say they are [-]jesus[/-] item.... [BGCOLOR=#FFFF00][b]One of them must be wrong[/b][/BGCOLOR]

Note: Have illustrated the codes, rather than repeating them as previous maths trade had issues with more than one suggested code confusing the maximiser.

better no, because it may affect John&#039;s magic. Just mark one of the entries as not available.

It won&#039;t affect my magic. Deletions are fine by me, we forbid them because people use the numbers to record what they want. With our new technology that rule may be obsolete.

	<body>Basic Game Version 3.0

I&#039;ve never played this. I picked it up as soon as I saw it due to nostalgia, but know I&#039;ll never get it to the table now since I discovered other games that suit my tastes.

In fact, even though the box looks like it has clearly been sitting on shelves since its release (Top dented in a bit, edges showing shelf wear), all the resource cards (full set, all 65) look unplayed, and the money is still perfectly ordered and stacked with card between each of the denominations. I am very strongly inclined to think this game has never been played.

Of the 370 plastic pieces stated to be in the box there a 368 (annoying because I bought it being told all pieces were there, the best I can do is tell you which two pieces are missing). It appears one orange square unit is missing, and one mushroom cloud is missing.
