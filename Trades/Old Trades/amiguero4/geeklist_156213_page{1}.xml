<title>Aussie Mid Year Math(s) Trade 2013</title>
<description>Welcome to the Mid Year Aussie Math(s) Trade 2013. 

Team behind this MT is:

[floatleft][username=Friendless][/floatleft][floatleft][username=mr_lunch][/floatleft][floatleft][username=Amiguero][/floatleft][clear]

[b][size=14]Rules:[/size][/b]

:d10-1:  This trade is open to Australian BGGers only.

:d10-2:  This trade is open to board games, expansions, card games, game accessories, RPG, video games and the like. Please don&#039;t add anything else. If you intend to allow a game to be exchanged for cash (i.e. you&#039;re selling), include the amount you will accept for it in the price. You may consider compare current market prices (ebay, BGG, local shop) 

:d10-3: Golden rule: [b][size=12]SENDER PAYS SHIPPING[/size][/b]. Even if you&#039;re selling a game for cash, or you post from Perth to Townsville or Hobart. So, make sure you set your price high enough that you would be happy to pay shipping to anywhere else in Australia out of that money. By posting an item to this list you are agreeing that you can and will mail it anywhere in Australia at your expense. 

:d10-4:  Items included in the maths trade are expected  to remain as part of the maths trade until the closing date. If your intention is to sell an item there are other alternatives in BGG to do so. If an item is not longer available for whatever reason, please indicate so with big letters.  If you decide to drop an item from the list, please do so before the due date of the game submission deadline. List order will be as per submissions. Note: your items could end up with a different item number due to deletions, so please check the official after the geeklist has been closed. Refer to the deadlines below.

:d10-5: Cash option once agains is available.

:d10-6:  Math Traders will not be required to add cash items to the geeklist - that will be handled in the want lists. In the case that a buyer offers more than a seller is asking, the buyer will pay the seller&#039;s price. 

:d10-7: Australian BGGers can participate even without submitting an item to the trade with the cash option by submitting want list before the due date.

:d10-8: Provide as much details as possible (edition, language, sleeved cards, condition of the game, etc). Pick a picture that represents the game you&#039;re offering if there are multiple versions. If necessary, take a picture of the game, upload it to your gallery, and use that image.  Feel free to use the game condition rating previously suggested by petegs to describe your items:

[b]New in shrink[/b] - which means never opened.
[b]Opened but unpunched[/b] - I&#039;ve looked at the game but not punched counters yet or stickered blocks etc.
[b]Opened and punched[/b] - Looked at, even punched counters etc but haven&#039;t played.
[b]Opened and played[/b].

Count pieces to make sure the games are complete, and accurately list any components that are missing or damaged. Please look at your trade pile to make sure the game is really there.  In order to make your items more (or less) appealing, you may want to add one or more &quot;sweeteners&quot; to the item listing -- an expansion, a related game, or a completely unrelated item that you think will make it a more desirable package.  Items for which there is no BGG listing can be listed as Miscellaneous Game Accessory. Please remember to link the sweeteners so the want lists tools can pick them up.

[b]Important:[/b] Use BGG image galleries rather than external hosting for your pics since we have access to scaling then, and this page will load faster.

:d10-9: There is no limit of items to be submitted in this trade. Duplicates of items already on the list are fine. Traders can combine multiple games into one item (e.g. 7 Wonders plus expansions).

:d10-1::d10-0: Keep comments for listed items to a minimum. There is a separate thread for any ad hoc messages and to post the results.

Official Results posted at Friendless discretion from Sunday 2 June 2013.

No extensions for deadlines above will be granted. For respect to your fellow Math Traders and to have enough time as people may need to get their games to a willing &#039;games mule&#039; attending BorderCon and/or T&amp;GE.

[i]Packing tips:[/i]

- Make sure the game contents are secure [i]inside[/i]the game and won&#039;t shift around.
- Place the game in a plastic bag to prevent water damage (in the event it is left out in the rain).
- Make sure there&#039;s cushioning around all side of the game.
- Use a proper box. (Auspost &quot;ToughBags&quot; won&#039;t prevent crushing.)
- Make sure the box is properly taped up.
- Make sure the address is clear and won&#039;t get torn off.

Da Moose&#039;s pricing is out of date.  Everything went up recently :soblue:

Thankfully they didn&#039;t go up as much as I feared.  Postage for Bx1 is now $7.15, Bx2 is 11.70, and Bx4 is $15.05.  Tracking is included (as before); add $2.95 for signature on delivery.

See, e.g., [url]http://auspost.com.au/parcels-mail/ebay-flat-rate-satchels-and-boxes.html[/url].  Box pricing may have changed as well

Rather than post a fixed version of the above, I&#039;ll let Moosey fix his :whistle:

Regards,

David.

The one in the VIC forums, which is the one link in the header. The idea for the mid year MT was to link it to BorderCon. The other trade at the year end is to link it to CanCon, so the ACT forum is used then.

The post in ACT is to let my fellow Canberrans that the MT is on.

Could someone please add a post in NSW forums? I don&#039;t want to be labelled as spammer and hear NSW users complaint about not telling them...

It is my fault, I shouldn&#039;t create the separate pst in ACT so soon. No point on having 2 separate threads, so redirect the link to ACT forum which has seen more activity than the other.

Going off on a tangent, it is usual for there to be a rush, close to the closing deadline, of people listing games at the last minute (I know I&#039;ve have just used a tautology).

Why do people do this?

Surely if you want to list a game you want to do it sooner rather than later so as to give other geeks as much time as possible to mull over the possibilities of making a trade with you.


=====*=====*=====*=====*=====*=====*=====*=====*=====*=====*=====*=====*


Going off on a different tangent, John, why have the results of the trade finalized only a few days before BorderCon? Personally, I leave for BorderCon on Saturday June 1st. Yes, it takes me a week to make it from Port Macquarie to Albury - I have a lot of people to visit on the way. Posting the results on June 2nd means that I won&#039;t see the results until I am a long way from home.

Do others feel that just three days notice between finalizing the trade and attending BorderCon is a tad counterproductive?

Speaking for myself:

[microbadge=9655] I like to spend some time contemplating my collection before listing any of my games. I&#039;m not a hoarder, but I am nostalgic and I can probably tell you off the top of my head where each and every one of my possessions came from. Sometimes I find it difficult to let things go. 

[microbadge=9365] I&#039;m also a procrastinator. This is not a good combination. :shake:

I hadn&#039;t actually noticed. It won&#039;t affect me much, but I agree that it&#039;s possibly cutting it a bit fine.

Well, considering you are my [-]transport[/-], [-]mule[/-], taxi to Albury I can see your point. Is there some form of Bring and Buy/Second Hand table at BorderCon, as I will need to pack all the games for the Math Trade. Not going to leave a lot of room for games we wish to play!

Hang on! It&#039;s a Station Wagon right? Just put the seats down....now to cull a few more games!!

It&#039;s usually Shawn and Big Neil and then Shawn gets called overseas on business.

I don&#039;t have the same time constraints as you, those dates work fine for me as it is only a 3-4 hour trip, although I have no issue the date being set to a week before BorderCon starts.  This may push the other dates forward of course...

I don&#039;t want to point fingers :thumbsup::thumbsdown: but that was the choice of someone else. He may have run it past me before posting it, but I admit I didn&#039;t pay a lot of attention as I just run the program. I&#039;m sure it&#039;s an oversight as we have traditionally planned dates to give people time to get organised.

I will of course post the results as soon as I have them, which will be the night of the 31st, unless I&#039;m too drunk by then. :zombie: Would Amiguero consider moving the date to the 30th, which is a school night and hence much more likely to find me sober (and more to the point, not out playing games)?

Hi John,

I wasn&#039;t complaining, I appreciate your efforts and I certainly didn&#039;t entertain the thought that you would adjust dates on my say so. I was really just pointing out something that I thought was sub-optimal and giving others a chance to air their thoughts.

Well you should complain, it&#039;s a problem :-). Particularly for the Perth guys who have to drive back across the Nullarbor after the results are announced to get their games.

[q=&quot;Friendless&quot;][q=&quot;da pyrate&quot;]John, why have the results of the trade finalized only a few days before BorderCon?[/q]

I don&#039;t want to point fingers :thumbsup::thumbsdown: but that was the choice of someone else. He may have run it past me before posting it, but I admit I didn&#039;t pay a lot of attention as I just run the program.

The list has been up since 20 Apr 13 and D Cox is raising the issue about the deadlines now :what:

Happy to support John&#039;s point on been sober, so the amended deadline for want list will be Thu 30 May :D

Ben and John have been extremely helpful doing the magic behind the scenes in the last 2 MTs, so I don&#039;t think bottle neck is there. I guess it all depends how fast John gets the want lists as to how quick result will be available, and that depends on all putting the that extra effort to get them not by the deadline but as early as possible.

Thank you Rene. I interpret the deadline as meaning people are ALLOWED to change their want lists until then, so I can&#039;t publish any results before then in case (for example), Neil remembers that one last thing he wanted to bid on. But one second after, it&#039;s on for young and old.

[q=&quot;da pyrate&quot;]Going off on a tangent, it is usual for there to be a rush, close to the closing deadline, of people listing games at the last minute (I know I&#039;ve have just used a tautology).

Why do people do this?

Surely if you want to list a game you want to do it sooner rather than later so as to give other geeks as much time as possible to mull over the possibilities of making a trade with you.

[/q]

Personally I just like all my items in one place, and doing it last minute let me do that (Because I can never decide what I really want to get rid of).  Maybe I should put it up earlier.

Yes Panda, your comprehension is excellent as is your ability to state the obvious. I am raising the issue now...well yesterday actually.

As I don&#039;t have a monopoly on intelligence...I thought it only fair to give the other geeks a month to point out the problem before stepping in myself.

And like the cavalry I always comes to the rescue at the last minute.

I&#039;m here to help.  :cool:

I did a quick check and found at least 4 items no longer available. I&#039;ll delete them on Friday.

Given the terrific work by mr_lunch in adding the codes, I&#039;ll use the moderators card to change the deadline of the Official list to Monday, so people can start early doing trade list. This will make Friendless happy so he can play games on Friday night and also D Cox happy so he can sail his way to Albury-Wodonga a week before BorderCon.

It looks like your doubts may have been unfounded.

Get ready to say 690 to the tune of 180.

Always happy to be wrong. 

Yay for the Mid Year Math Trade. 

The quality on offer here is outstanding I think. I wish I had stuff to put up that would have half a chance of snaring some of it.

The amount of unplayed comments would also suggest that we are either downsizing in a huge way or that we buy way too much.

And what a last game it is! 

First MT in years that I haven&#039;t put up items. Just haven&#039;t payed enough...

So is this a record?

We have many first time listers I think. Yay to that.

Good timing!

I&#039;ll have a look to the list to see if there is any item unavailable that can be deleted. Please let me know if you see any of those.

I don&#039;t think deletion will change codes, so you could start working on want list now.

EDIT: After deadline tomorrow, no further comments would be allowed to the MT.

So is this a record?
[/q]

Yes and no.

Yes it&#039;s a record for a mid-year maths trade in Australia.

No it isn&#039;t a record for all maths trades in Australia.  The year end ones traditionally attract more items (as you know Neil).  

However overall the newcomers have boosted this one significantly and it places third all time on the Aussie wide maths trade list.

Keep in mind that of the 12 we&#039;ve conducted (as far as I know) this is only the second one that has had entries removed when pre-trades/sales have occured.  Previously they were left in place, which means that earlier maths trades had fewer items available than the final number indicates.

For the record:

Made it this time. I&#039;m learning to organise my life around these maths trades but its hard. I would prefer we had 2 days only to put items up. That would get people fired up! Anyhow remember my philosophy 

Cash is King, the rest is just conversation.

When Rene posted this there were ~350 items (hard to tell with deletions).  That means approx 500 items were added in the last 7 days (out of the 36 days this list was open).  Perhaps a 2 week window is in order next time?

It happens every time and it is ridiculous. Don&#039;t these people realize how much more difficult they make it for organizers by dumping all this information on the list at the last minute.

When I was doing this it would take ages to add the codes and being able to do it earlier certainly made it easier than having to stay up late at the last minute.

The simple solution I guess is to make the deadline a week earlier than the organisers need it to be so they have the time. 

Given how many items are added in the last week I don&#039;t think dropping a week off would be a bad thing as people are obviously needing a deadline to get their butts into gear.

Making it too short though can be problematic as some people actually want to see some items up before they go to the effort. 

I actually think that this trade had a real sense of &#039;oh great stuff on there, I&#039;ll need to match it if I want a chance to win some of it&#039;.

There was a lot of great stuff...I think much better without the hordes of video games that were in the previous list.

One thing that continues to surprise me is the number of cheap games listed as single items. Looking at them, it would be cheaper for me to simply purchase them from Milsims rather than look to trading and suffer the cost of posting items that goes side-by-side with that.

It&#039;s a balancing act.  What you say is true, but I&#039;m wary of trading for a pile of games, only one of which I want, and imagine there are others like me.  Besides, if small items trade for small items, shouldn&#039;t the postage be reasonable for both parties?

Actually there were only nine video games listed last time - hardly a horde. And if they (or any of the &#039;cheap games listed as single items&#039;) end up resulting in more trades, that&#039;s a good thing. Having a bunch of items on the list that you&#039;re not interested in doesn&#039;t actually make it harder for you to snag the games you [i]are[/i] interested in.

You&#039;re out of date David, we have programs for all that now. I think time will be a bit tight for people to get their want lists together, but I&#039;ve planned to not go out any evening this week so I can compile the lists and get back to people with errors ASAP. This evening I&#039;ll post the first of the &quot;these people haven&#039;t submitted their wants lists&quot; posts. The trade codes were up about 23 hours early, while Ben was comfortably renovating his house :-).

Edit: and in fact all 3 organisers added items on the last day!

Ha, I suppose so. Funnily enough my notion of what constitutes a horde was wholly shaped by a video game - Heroes of Might &amp; Magic II - which used the following numbering system for its stacks of monsters:

&quot;Few&quot; = 0 to 4
&quot;Several&quot; = 5 to 9
&quot;Pack&quot; = 10 to 19
&quot;Lots&quot; = 20 to 49
&quot;Horde&quot; = 50 to 99
&quot;Throng&quot; = 100 to 249
&quot;Swarm&quot; = 250 to 499
&quot;Zounds&quot; = 500 to 999
&quot;Legion&quot; = 1000 to 32767

Using this system, the previous maths trade had a legion of items, of which merely several were video games. Meanwhile, I was romping around with my unstoppable army containing a legion of skeletons and a throng of vampire lords. Good times.

[/q]

It&#039;s the main reason why I&#039;ve decided to group a few games together in this MT. Living in regional Australia, the cost of shipping just doesn&#039;t justify looking at those smaller/cheaper items. The flip-side of this is it&#039;s hard to get 2-3 items into a bundle that will all interest the same person. 

Another funny thing is, browsing through the list, when I see a game I love with &#039;Still in shrink&#039; or &#039;Only played once&#039;, I think to myself &#039;Oh, if only they could play that wonderful game, they&#039;d love it&#039;.

Personally, I think both the person sending and receiving has an obligation to work together to optimise the shipping charges and bundling via BorderCon.

I&#039;ve got Mall of Horrors, which I really enjoy, and this just hasn&#039;t made it to the table more than twice i think. It&#039;s clunky and a bit of a dice fest. It&#039;s one i wanted to like, but I think I&#039;m over Zombies and want to maybe swap it for something I&#039;ll actually get to the table.

	<body>Opened. Played only twice.
Box has a couple of scrapes on corners, but no dents.
All components in excellent condition.


Language is German. English translation included. Very low language dependance.

The box includes two Catan historical scenarios; (i) Cheops, and (ii) Alexander the Great.

I don&#039;t have a copy of Catan anymore, so this expansion is no good to me.

I&#039;ll be at BorderCon</body>

The &#039;geek treats RPGs and their child Items as different beasts. Since we draw the content from the XML, this entry comes up as the parent RPG (http://rpggeek.com/rpg/355/james-bond-007), not the item pictured (http://rpggeek.com/rpgitem/43985/james-bond-007).

	<body>Just like Subbuteo Football (soccer)

Simulate Union and League and I am pretty sure I saw some AFL rules on the web. Also includes a Subbuteo catalogue from 1974/1975.

Box is dished and a little scuffed. One red player has had a serious injury (both legs broken) but he is all fixed now.

New players and teams are available still (try worldsubbuteorugby.co.uk)</body>

Edit: I&#039;ve had offers to buy this from me, but I actually want a game for it :-).

I hope you have two copies of this game, otherwise, after you play it you will surely want a personal copy.

Do both planes come with a full deck of manoeuvre cards, stands and altitude pegs?

If so, would you accept a cash offer for &#039;em?

Of course - both are unflown and pristine with all the good bits you would expect.

If you were at BorderCon I would sell them for $20. I am not interested in selling if I have to cover postage...for that I would prefer a trade.

I won&#039;t be at Bordercon, but I may know someone who will be and can effect this transaction, would it be okay to do it that way?

Sorry, but what does this mean?

My potential &#039;mule&#039; - despite being on BGG and even sending me an e-mail hasn&#039;t bothered to answer my questions as to whether or not he&#039;s going to bordercon.

So, has this gone to someone else?

I&#039;m abandoning all Queen Games until I get my English cards for [thing=16496][/thing]. (Probably a grievance best discussed elsewhere.)

Seriously though - Queen Games are great... for storage. You can usually fit ten other games in one of their big box games - plus the original game! It&#039;s a bargain! Strangely my memory isn&#039;t what it was and I&#039;ve now misplaced several of my smaller games. So if anyone has bought any of my Queen Games big box games, you should open the box (no, not to play it silly ), and you might find a good game inside.

[size=7]*Please note that I&#039;ve never played [thing=691][/thing] and it might be an awesome game. Not meaning to rain of Jenny&#039;s parade. Warning: Some parts may cause cancer, but probably only in California.[/size]

Digressing even more, if you emailed Nikki from Queen Games again on kickstarter she maybe able to help.  I got my new ones recently after emailing her again about half a month ago.  Was pleasantly surprised when it actually turned up.

It actually just looks like you have managed to get all of the awful Queen games (Colonia! :gulp:) and dodged all of the great ones (Lancaster, Chicago Express, etc.). Lancaster doesn&#039;t even have free space in the box!

Lindsay - exactly. I&#039;ve lost a few card games that way precisely. Lucky these are shrinkwrapped still!

Roma is one of their best games, for sure. I just feel like the bulk of their games are just abstracts with nice themes and beautiful box art pasted on. And I just noticed I forgot to list Eketorp. Ha.

In terms of pure value it would probably make sense John.

But they might be less enticing for a trade if they are separated. 

Pretty sure the base game would go in a flash at the least though.

Then you&#039;re stuck trying to get rid of the expansions by themselves.  I&#039;ve been there, regretted that.

I reckon that&#039;s unlikely to be an issue. GMT has been pretty good about keeping the base game in print but that is not true of the expansions. If anything they are probably in greater demand.

I want Expansion #1, but none of the rest. FWiW, I think the expansions are OOP once again, although GMT will get them back in production pretty soon. #1 is $80+ on eBay.

Offering the whole lot together is certainly going to make it one of the most valuable items. Will watch with interest.

Duplicate copy.  I am sure if you look this up on ebay somebody will say it is uber-rare. This is quite possibly not true although I didn&#039;t notice another copy of this on the trade list yet, so maybe it is or the other copies are just being tightly held :ninja:

Lots of &quot;occasional&quot; gamers seem to have copies, and (shudder) a couple of years back it was frequently recommended for kids in their early teens. Since Talisbloop is only tolerable when consuming large quantities of alcohol, this never seemed like a good fit - but nonetheless...

I loved 1st ed (with many 2nd ed expansions) as a pre-teen and teen. I just found the game too slow and random as an adult.

I have a description for a bunch of games which is &quot;teenage boy game&quot;.  Talisman fits.  A game that goes on and on and on, usually with constant fighting. 

The sort of game that I would have loved playing (endlessly) as a teenage boy, but would not be likely to play so often now.

I have a friend with 2nd edition plus all expansions. When I mentioned the length issue to him he said that he and his sons are so familiar with the game and its expansions that they know just where to go and the game goes much quicker than the base game alone as everyone levels up really fast.

Actually the one he said made the biggest difference was Dragons. They enabled everyone to level up very quickly and so get to the end without a lot of fuss.

	<body>Played four times, loved it but can&#039;t afford to keep up with several LCGS - thematically this is my least fav so it is out the door.  

All cards are sleeved and well cared for.

The box has very minor shelf wear, except for one top corner where the linen finish has developed a slight rip along the folded edge - anyone who owns an FFG game will know what I&#039;m talking about. It&#039;s only a minor blemish, and the box is structurally very sound.

Please note: this does not include any expansion packs.

Open to pre-trade offers.

	<body>This is a great copy with no visible wear on the components, cards, and boards. 
There are two names written quite small inside the box lid and that is it&#039;s only fault :)</body>

Hi Chris, sorry not at this time. I think they are more enticing as one larger package when trying to trade them all away in one shot.

I&#039;ve used it for storage of board game bits, but I also always thought it&#039;d make a great thing-to-roll-dice-in as it&#039;s lined with (what I think is) red felt. I can&#039;t remember where I got it or how much it cost me. 


I&#039;ll also include a game:

This was received in the last Maths Trade, fun abstract, but beyond my daughter who I got it for. Also fell flat with my wife who doesn&#039;t like it 2 player.

	<body>This is an old Unhalfbricking games demo copy. Has a Unhalfbricking sticker on the lid! Unplayed by my wife and I as it requires 3 players minimum and we play most games 2 player. Looks to be a good game, or at least the rules sounded fun...

Condition: Open, sorted. Box is showing some minor shelf wear.

Edit: I&#039;ll be honest here, I&#039;m so far only interested in trading this for two or three games on the list so far. But hey... you never know! 

Edit two: This game was originally [thing=111732][/thing]. However I was convinced in the comments below that I should give it a go. (Still can&#039;t remember why it was placed on the trade pile.) I recently bought this on the ipad and find it much easier to play (actually it really is only the set up and pack away that is easier), especially since I mostly play this solo.</body>

Seriously?  This a great game, Damien. You&#039;ve got Railways of the World and Merchants of Venus rated at &#039;9&#039;; this is also a pickup and deliver game, very easy to learn, perhaps a little more tactical depth than RotW (more things to do with less actions). I am pretty sure you&#039;d love it, and thoroughly recommend giving it a try before you trade it out.

Your right... and I know your right... its just that I can&#039;t get it to the table... That&#039;s really no excuse is it?

I&#039;ll read the rules again tonight and try and remember why it got shoved to the back of the pile.

I put this one up with hesitation, and I&#039;ll leave it hear for now but its a less likely to be traded with Andrew&#039;s recommendation going for it.

Great game, and I am surprised that the deduction/ card playing element of this game hasn&#039;t taken off in more games. Up for trade mostly because of my inability to get this to the table.

Also the blue cards show some variation in colour but doesn&#039;t affect play as these cards are auctioned face up.

Are they in the new 3 copies per card (60 cards) format or in the old 40 cards format?  Also, I guess you won&#039;t be separating them?

Also same Qu for kings of the seas

Hi Eric, I&#039;ve updated my post with that information:

The expansion packs are the 40 cards per pack expansions. 
The Kings of the sea is the 60 card pack with the House Greyjoy &quot;Arms of the Kraken&quot; resin card

	<body>This year&#039;s &quot;they-made-it-unplayable-for-colourblind-folks&quot; tale of woe. The colours were OK on the original edition.

This is a neat semi-abstract game, with a scoring mechanism I have not seen anywhere else. Similar weight and duration to [thing=4636][/thing].

This copy is nearly pristine. [i]It has not been played at all[/i] :cry: .

[floatright][ImageID=259380small][/floatright]Comes with a copy of [thing=32382][/thing] which is also not friendly for colourblind people but is at least manageable. Has been played ~5 times and is in excellent condition.

In better than excellent condition (cards sleeved for play) because the game artist has drawn his own illustration on the inside of the box lid and made it out to me (in French even!) at Essen 2010.

Open to pre-trades if your name is also Adam.

(P.s 10 miniature are painted and other are pre-primered with black coat) (Note:  4 of the puppet masters still unpainted)

it is a good light miniature game and all components are in great condition, but for us this game don&#039;t hit the table often so we decided to find a new home for him. </body>

	<body>Open and played - maybe twice.  Includes we have the bomb promo. Cards unsleeved, but it comes with a promo card for 25% off Mayday card sleeves! (which may or may not have expired)

Box has some small wear from shipping due to Mayday Games being silly buggers.  But it kinda suits the apocalypse ammo-tin look.  

Cash: $25</body>

Quad-fold game board has been split on one quadrant during unfolding by an overzealous daughter, but has since been taped up on the back.  Otherwise all else is in great condition!

	<body>Excellent condition, played once.  Includes all Indiegogo promos, including  coloured resin spaceship minis, which according to the publisher, were discontinued due to problems with the resin colouring process (I opted to continue to receive the coloured spaceships rather than uncoloured ones, and they look ok to me). All cards are sleeved because sleeves were one of the bonuses!

I&#039;m willing to do a cash trade for this one. How much do you want for it?

PS. I&#039;m reasonably new to BGG and this is my first time on this forum so I&#039;ve no idea how this works. I&#039;ve subscribed to this thread, whatever that means, but if you have time can you PM me? Sorry

Damn - forgot about cash stuff. I&#039;ll put &#039;reasonable&#039; prices on most things (I define reasonable as about half new price + what i estimate postage to be). For this one, probably $50.

Hey Tegs;

All you need is this set, or any &quot;starter&quot; kit. Which contains a deck/army for each player and a board (I think its a paper mat in this version and a proper board in the [thing=93260][/thing]) for the play area. 

Hope that helps.

That&#039;s right. Either one of these by themselves is enough for a 2 player game. With both you can play with 4 players (if you really want) or just mix and match for 2 players. They both come with (fairly crappy, but that&#039;s not my fault - that&#039;s what they are) paper &quot;boards&quot; folded up in the pack. They are very unimpressive but eminently functional for the game.

Hi Terry, The fine print says &quot;ZMAN&quot; and &quot;Bruges&quot;, not &quot;Brügge&quot;.

I think you should change the image to the correct one (#1545558), so there&#039;s no confusion regarding the fine print. As we browse through hundreds of entries compiling our trade wants it&#039;s easy to miss the fine print and focus on the bigger image of the game provided. Or has that only happened to me?

	<body>Artscow cards for USA, Germany, Russia and Japan as well as the action deck or whatever it&#039;s called.  The cards have had about 5 games worth of play so are in excellent condition. 
If you want them it can also include my DIY counters which are thick and perfectly playable but not the prettiest.

	<body>Picked up in last trade and played [-]I think once[/-]. Edit: to be clear, played once by me, plus an unknown number of times by the previous owner. The main clock hand on the board is broken off but this is not an obstacle to play -- otherwise very good condition.

Anyone sick of Mediterranean cube trading must surely be interested in a game about Swedish symphonic metal band Therion attempting to avert Ragnarok by discovering and playing the &quot;Inscrutable Organ of Eternity&quot;.

	<body>This is [b]a PnP copy[/b] of Martin Wallace&#039;s upcoming game, [COLOR=#000099][b]A Study in Emerald[/b][/COLOR]. 

I did a bit of a graphic redesign on the board/cards and and it printed through [b]ArtsCow[/b]: The Board is a 12x18 inch place mat (effectively a jumbo mousepad), and the cards were printed through them as well. I handmade the agent tokens. 

I believe the only thing you&#039;ll need to provide yourself is the player cubes &amp; discs (20 &amp; 15, respectively; in 5 colors). 

Let me know if you have any questions...

	<body>Black Box Edition (as pictured)

Includes a bunch of kickstarter rewards like [thing=107998][/thing], camp raisers and enamel pin. Opened but unplayed. Has a dent in one corner of the box due to dodgy shipping methods during distribution but game contents are in perfect condition.

Also includes [thing=17449][/thing]. Opened and played twice but in perfect condition.</body>

European edition (ie. no English rules) but I have printed a colour copy out.

Other components are in very good condition - the game was only played a handful of times. You have everything you need in here to play.

	<body>[size=18][b]German[/b][/size] edition, played once. I won, so I have to get rid of it now to ensure my streak is never broken. Includes printout of English rules.

(Note that as far as German-language editions go it&#039;s a bit pathetic. The only German text on anything other than the rules are the titles of the scandal cards, which also have [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/image/1526372/noblemen]language-independent icons[/url], and one of them is sort of in English anyway because &quot;Whitehall&quot; is left &quot;Whitehall&quot;. And [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/image/1499976/noblemen]all of the titles[/url] are English.)

	<body>[b]This is NOT an official version of Up Front, nor is it a complete copy of the game.[/b]

It is a collection of about 350+ cards based on davidmps&#039;s unofficial re-design of the cards (see here: http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/458796/up-front-redesign).

Essentially I waited years for Up Front to be reprinted, then decided to bite the bullet and reprint the redesign through artscow.

As a result, I have 7 decks of 54 cards. This includes the complete Action deck, the Personality cards, plus some extra blanks that I printed off [just in case I later lost or damage a card]. 

I should clarify, it doesn&#039;t have the expansions, it&#039;s just the base Up Front (ie: Germans, Russians and Americans), but for each of these forces there appear to be are a few extra cards over what was in the original base game.

This does not include rules or counters (though it would be easy to print those off). 

The one minor problem with these cards is that there should be A (1-5), A (6-10, B(1-5), B (6-10). But instead of this I&#039;ve printed 2x A (1-5), 2x B (1-5), etc, so 10 cards have &#039;A&#039; instead of &#039;B&#039; on them. This is easily &#039;patched&#039; (and I can do it for anyone interested).

I&#039;m happy to answer any queries about these. Essentially I lost interest in the game so never completed it, but thought somebody might want them (can I emphasise how awesome the redesigned cards look).

This is the second printing with the corrected counter alignment, although some are still a little off centre. Totally playable and not very noticeable.

If unsure you can find more info on this in the game forums. </body>

Contains everything unpunched except for the San Juan expansions which are mine, all mine! So that leaves:

New buildings for Puerto Rico
Nine new cards for Notre Dame
A small set of new events for In the Year of the Dragon
Building the Chinese wall for In the Year of the Dragon
Material for a 6th player in Witch&#039;s Brew
&#039;Magic abilities&#039; for Witch&#039;s Brew
Amulets for Witch&#039;s Brew. For a more exciting game with fewer players.
A new table for Louis XIV
Princess and the Muse expansion for The Princes of Florence
2-player expansion for The Princes of Florence</body>

	<body>This game is in lightly-played, fine-to-excellent condition, with the following small exceptions:
- the box cover is dented (noticeable, but not dramatic, and still entirely functional)
- the insert is missing (to make room for all the bits, especially once you start adding expansions)
- one (of 42) of the Cosmic Tokens is missing (this will have zero effect on gameplay, as these are generic tokens used for various purposes in the game and you&#039;ll never use them all).
Otherwise, everything is in great shape!

	<body>Great condition, but a flimsy box that is dented a bit.

PLUS

[thing=8522][/thing]
[ImageID=47910]

Unplayed by me, but components show some wear and the previous owner has underlined lots of things on the rules sheet. Lots of shelf-wear to box and some dishing to box.

	<body>Shrinkwrapped/Excellent Condition.  Although the printing of the Black Box version was plagued with bubbling and creases on the boxes, this is the best-looking copy I found and it looks fine!

Includes ALL SIX Kickstarter Extras!
(1) [thing=107998][/thing]
    [ImageID=1079452] (actual cards slightly different than this picture)
(2) Cards for the I.V version of the game
(Promo Cards)
    [ImageID=1308927] 
(Republic Expansion)
    [ImageID=1308932] 
(Merchant Bonus cards)
    [ImageID=1308928] 
(3) &quot;Travel&quot; version of the player camps
    [ImageID=1084685]
(4) Player camp &quot;risers&quot; - 30 clear plastic feet (so 6 per camp)
(5) A Leader badge
    [ImageID=1413744]
(6) A Leader pin (the same as #5, but with a pin on the back for wearing)

These Extras look something like this:
[ImageID=1411997] (The Leader pin is not pictured)

This version of the game is out of print and no one knows when it will be printed again.

$80 for the maths trade (which includes shipping, of course).

I&#039;m open to offers before the finalisation of the maths trade.
I&#039;ll be at Bordercon!</body>

	<body>[b]Glory To Rome: Black Box: The Apology Letter![/b]

Excellent Condition.  

This is a handwritten letter (addressed to me and dated 19 June, 2012) from Ed Carter, Managing Director of Cambridge Games Factory.  (It includes the address of the house he no longer owns.)  Individuals who pledged at certain levels of the (disastrous) Kickstarter campaign were given the benefit of receiving this letter.  It was supposed to be an apology for inflicting the art from the original version of the game on the game-buying public.  But, after all the troubles of the Kickstarter campaign, it ended up being an apology for the late deliveries of the game to Australia.  (So, even the apology letter was not what it was advertised to be...)

Now you can own a piece of Kickstarter and Glory To Rome history!

$20 for the maths trade (which includes shipping, of course).

I&#039;m open to offers before the finalisation of the maths trade.
I&#039;ll be at Bordercon!</body>

This is the AEG Preview edition, which is in a half size box. Comes with full manual, but unfortunately this doesn&#039;t fit in the box. Good if you like small boxes and only need to read manuals once.

	<body>Like new, except that two of the cards have very slight indentations on the back from the plastic seal on the baggie they were shipped in (I received them in this condition).  It doesn&#039;t really affect playability, as you can only see the indentations under light from a certain angle.

This set of promo cards is now ridiculously hard to obtain!

$20 for the maths trade (which includes shipping, of course).

Note that this is for two expansions and does not include the base game.  My understanding is that you CAN play with just these two expansions as long as you have the rules for the base game (available here on BGG).

(which adds cards, the ability to play with up to 6 playera, new Encounters, specific Blood Testing of other players, and other ways to expand your adventures in Antarctica circa 1982).

Excellent Condition.

These were printed using the &quot;official&quot; files on Artscow and the cards look great!

This game wonderfully captures the feel and narrative flow of the John Carpenter film.  Since the expansion is included, up to six can play.

Excellent condition.

This is the original printing of this title.  It&#039;s a great version of Ticket To Ride for 2-3 players.

$22 for the maths trade (which includes shipping, of course).

	<body>Fine Condition.

Ted Alspach, creator of the &quot;Board 2 Pieces&quot; comic strip, follows his Start Player game with the ability to always resolve ties.  No longer will &quot;players rejoice in their shared victory&quot;!

Includes a giant TieBreaker meeple and 54 cards.  (Note: The box says 60 cards, but the game actually comes with just 54.)

$14 for the maths trade (which includes shipping, of course).

I&#039;m open to offers before the finalisation of the maths trade.
I&#039;ll be at Bordercon!</body>

Fine Condition.

The Time&#039;s Up! expansion features names of games (mostly Euro, but also some Ameritrash and classic family games) and famous designers.  The answers on the cards are in English, French and German, so you can play with a truly international group!

A Game Of Games is essentially Password using game names (again, mostly Euros).  It was given out to attendees of Alan Moon&#039;s Gathering Of Friends in 2008.  I&#039;ve marked some of the cards in A Game Of Games to indicate which I&#039;ve played.  This will not affect playability for you at all.

$20 for the maths trade (which includes shipping, of course).

I&#039;m open to offers before the finalisation of the maths trade.
I&#039;ll be at Bordercon!

This works as both a family game as well as a light Euro for gamers.  It has similarities to Knizia&#039;s Africa, but with more opportunities for strategic plays that will affect the other players.

This is a card game produced through the IndieGoGo crowdfunding website. You are trying to have your Survivors outrun the Zombie Horde (and the other Survivors) to get to the safety of the bunker.

[thing=70940][/thing]
[ImageID=721566]

AND

[thing=63214][/thing]
[ImageID=694131]

Everything is stored in the Wrath of the Elements box (and the other boxes are gone).  The rulebook for the Base Game is missing, but is replaced by a colour print-out of it.  The other rulebooks are fine.

I believe this is the first edition of the game.

I got this in the Maths Trade a year ago and it has remained untouched by me since then.  So, it&#039;s time to pass it on!  [The original entry from a year ago is here - http://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/140281/item/2104151#item2104151 ]

$50 for the maths trade (which includes shipping, of course).

I&#039;m open to offers before the finalisation of the maths trade.

[IMAGEID=263871]

Played a few times, German text covered with English paste ups and includes English rules; also on the back of the box crease running from top to bottom.

Plus
[GAMEID=21631]
[IMAGEID=109027]
Bought second hand played a couple of times in very good condition; includes English rules.
