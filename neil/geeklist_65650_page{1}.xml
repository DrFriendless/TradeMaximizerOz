<title>The Australian Mid Year Maths Trade</title>
<description>This is about the 6th Aussie maths trade. John lost count...I&#039;m just copying his content. :D

This Math Trade is brought to you by the amalgamation of Friendless and SoccerGeeks. He got the head but I got the body! :whistle:

We are going with the cash option as per the Trade in January of this year. This may be even more valuable here if people haven&#039;t managed to play their trades from Jan. 

By posting an item to this list you are agreeing that you can mail it anywhere in Australia at your expense. If it looks like that&#039;s going to cost a lot, make sure you don&#039;t trade it for something crap.

Unlike last Trade there will be [b][u]no removal of entries[/u][/b] possible as this made it difficult for some people to track items.

If you&#039;d like to know more about cash bids look here (discussion starts on Page 2) -

http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/483458/australian-ultimate-t...

It seemed to work well in January so we&#039;ll go for it again. Of course, as with all maths trades, the results will always be consistent with what you want. More details below. The motivation for this is to allow people with more games to get rid of than they want to receive to decrease their number of games whilst still getting something of value in exchange; and alternately, so that people who have nothing to trade can participate.
[b]
Specific Rules:[/b]
This trade is open to Australian BGGers only.

This trade is open to board games, expansions, card games, game accessories, and the like. Please don&#039;t add anything else. If you intend to allow a game to be exchanged for cash (i.e. you&#039;re selling), please include the amount you will accept for it in the price. My guiding philosophy in the design of the cash bidding system is that there be no nasty surprises.

Having said that, make sure you understand that in ALL cases, SENDER PAYS SHIPPING. Even if you&#039;re selling a game for cash, SENDER PAYS SHIPPING. Even to Perth or Townsville or Hobart. So, make sure you set your price high enough that you would be happy to pay shipping to anywhere else in Australia out of that money. SENDER PAYS SHIPPING.

Also, BGG runs a marketplace where sellers pay 3% commission to BGG, and I believe that tithe should apply here as well. As Aldie&#039;s debt-collectors don&#039;t get over this way very much, I suggest that sellers make a donation of that 3% using the standard BGG donation system.

Buyers will not be required to add cash items to the geeklist - that will be handled in the want lists. In the case that a buyer offers more than a seller is asking, the buyer will pay the seller&#039;s price. Sorry sellers, this is not an auction, this is a maths trade, and you only get as much as you ask for.
[b]
Limits:[/b]
Feel free to put as many items on the list as you want. Duplicates of items already on the list are okay. You can combine multiple games into one item (e.g. Carcassonne plus expansions).

Please describe the edition, language, and condition of the game. Pick a picture that represents the game you&#039;re offering if there are multiple versions. If necessary, take a picture of the game, upload it to your gallery, and use that image.

Please count pieces to make sure the games are complete, and accurately list any components that are missing or damaged. Please look at your trade pile to make sure the game is really there.

In order to make your items more (or less) appealing, you may want to add one or more &quot;sweeteners&quot; to the item listing -- an expansion, a related game, or a completely unrelated item that you think will make it a more desirable package.

Items for which there is no BGG listing can be listed as Miscellaneous Game Accessory.

[b]Algorithm:[/b]
Trade lists will be found by TradeMaximizer using SCALED-PRIORITIES, ALLOW-DUMMIES, REQUIRE-COLONS and REQUIRE-USERNAMES switches. The actual code is a heavily modified version of Trade Maximiser 1.3a, modified to allow geeklist integration (as we&#039;ve been using in Australia for a couple of years) and now the cash bids. The (Java) source code will be available to anyone who&#039;s interested.

[b]Deadlines:[/b]
Add items to, and remove items from the list by: 6pm Sunday 8th of May, 2011.

Official item list posted by: 6pm Tuesday 10th of May, 2011.

Want Lists Due By: 6pm Tuesday May 17th, 2011.

Official Results Posted By: 6pm Wednesday May 18th, 2011. 

There really is no leeway for that, as people may need to get their games to a willing &#039;games mule&#039; that is attending BorderCon. There is no direct link between BorderCon and this Math Trade, but it is a handy event to exchange items at for those attending. 

[b]Format:[/b]
The official item list will be of a format something like:
001-TWIXT
002-BMOON
003-PUERT
004-TICHU

Want lists must be submitted in a format like

(your user name-Friendless) 001-TWIXT : 004-TICHU 002-BMOON

indicating that Friendless, the person who put item 001, a Twixt game, into the list would be willing to accept either item 004, a Tichu game, or item 002, Blue Moon, in trade for it. The order of listing is your order of preference, in case both trades are possible.

The order of wants is a tiebreaker only. The system will first try to maximise the number of trades, even if this means that you get your last preference. The order of your wants will only be considered if there are multiple ways to get the maximum trades. But, fear not! You will never get a game that is not on your want list.

If you put 5 games on this trade list, you will be submitting 5 different want lists.

You may also submit want lists for cash bids. In that case, you write something like this:

(your user name-Friendless) $20 : 004-TICHU 002-BMOON

meaning that Friendless has $20 and he&#039;ll pay it for either Tichu or Blue Moon. You could also write this:

(your user name-Friendless) $10 : 004-TICHU
(your user name-Friendless) $20 : 002-BMOON

meaning that Friendless will pay $10 for Tichu and $20 for Blue Moon, so Friendless could be up for $30 total. To ensure that you don&#039;t spend all of your beer money, you can add a spending limit just like this:

(your user name-Friendless) LIMIT : $30

which means that no matter what happens, Friendless won&#039;t win trades such that he has to spend more than $30. I&#039;ll tell you how that works. We run the trade algorithm, and inspect the results. If anyone has exceeded their spending limit, their highest-priced successful bid is removed and the algorithm is re-run. Continue until all spending limits are satisfied. If you don&#039;t specify a spending limit, the program infers a limit which is the highest amount you&#039;ve been for any single item. That will be a rather conservative limit, but follows the maxim of no nasty surprises.

To sell a game, you can submit a trade list like this:

(your user name-Friendless) 001-TWIXT : 004-TICHU 002-BMOON $30

meaning that for Twixt Friendless will accept Tichu, or Blue Moon, or $30 from anyone who&#039;s offering cash.

Finally, do not try to screw the system. The program will reject nonsense like this:

(Friendless) $10: $20
(Friendless) %CASH: $20
(Friendless) $10: %CASH
(Friendless) $20: $10

and furthermore John reserves the right to change the program to reject anything else he sees as a scam and not an honest trade. Please post any questions in the Geeklist Comments below.

Detailed discussions should be had here -

I am expecting this one to suffer the mid-year trade curse and be less of a hit, but you never know, it might just break the pattern. I will go through my collection to see what I can put up, but given my huge success in the January trade, it probably won&#039;t be much.

Hi Neil, 

Thanks for stepping up to do this. You should mark this as a Trade/Auction List as it is appearing under the normal Geeklists on the front page - there is a check box when you create it and I assume it is also there when you edit it, as this is not the first time someone has done this.

:D

Thank you Neil!

Could people listing games please indicate whether they will be at Bordercon, or have arranged a proxy? It may not alter anyone&#039;s trade offers, but it could speed-up arrangements afterwards. :)

I am undecided about bordercon at this stage.
So I am hedging my best at the moment.  I will update with prices and attendance to bordercon at a later date.

Cheers Paul - Fixed that.

True Liam it may be too soon but let&#039;s have a go and see what we end up with. I think the cash option helps out if something you have to have is put up and you don&#039;t have any trades.

BorderCon attendance would be nice to help with the &#039;mule&#039; arrangements.

I&#039;m pretty new to math trades and I&#039;m potentially interested in participating, but I&#039;m trying to figure out if it&#039;s worthwhile given the shipping costs.  Any advice about good methods of shipping within Australia that don&#039;t cost a fortune?  

I recently had to return a game I&#039;d ordered from an online retailer (about 2kg, in a standard 43cm x 30.5cm x 14cm Australia Post sized box with packing peanuts), and it cost me $20 in postage via standard mail as a regular parcel to the other side of the country! ([url=http://auspost.com.au/apps/domestic-parcel.html]Postage Assessment Calculator[/url])  For me it&#039;s just not going to be worth trading some games at those amounts. 

Is that typically what it&#039;s going to cost to send a medium box game like Twilight Struggle or Dominion, or are there cheaper shipping options?

Show up at Bordercon!  :laugh:

Unless sending to/from WA, it is usually $10-$15.  If you can wrap the game up in bubbles and put it in a pre-paid stachel (about $10), that is the best way to go.  Avoid boxes, as they will charge per cubic cm. Which is almost always more than if they charged by weight for games.

So, if you have to send in a box, make your box an odd shape, so they can&#039;t easily cube it, then they will just charge by weight.

I&#039;d never do satchels, except for maybe small card games. If someone sent me a proper sized game I&#039;d paid or traded for that wasn&#039;t in a proper A3 or A4 box, or without filler material such as bubble-wrap or styrofoam pellets, I reckon I&#039;d be upset at the risk taken. Everything I&#039;ve received from gaming buddies has always been boxed and filled, so I&#039;d be  reckoning that&#039;s the norm and the expectation.

Normal postage cost for an A3 sized box would be $11-14 between Sydney and Melbourne, double or more to Perth.

That&#039;s right Jaime - you should be trading out games that you haven&#039;t played yet so that you can trade your mid-year wins away again in the Christmas Maths Trade to get them back!

Thanks so much for running this Neil!

My one suggestion regarding cash after the last trade was that if someone exceeds their limit, their lowest value want should be removed, not highest. The 2 benefits are: 

1. People are likely to spend closer to their limits, increasing the number of trades. This is particularly true for people with expensive for-cash items on their want lists. For example, if my limit is $100 and I go over by $5, and then a $50 game is removed, suddenly I&#039;m only spending $55 and likely not getting as much as I was hoping for.

2. More of the bigger ticket for-cash games will be sold. If someone wants to sell something awesome for say $80, heaps of people may want it, but it may not go because it keeps breaking people&#039;s limits. Also I&#039;m guessing that if someone wants this holy grail $80 item, as well as a bunch of small common $10-$20 games, they would rather get the grail than 4 small games.

Anyway, it is just a thought, feel free to ignore. Plus I may well be missing some negative effects of going this way, but it make sense to me (as I understand how cash works!)

Hi Ender-

I have had several bad experiences with eBay sellers using insufficient mailing materials, with games arriving crushed or damaged. This also happened the last time I used Amazon. I have also seen an Australia Post employee [i]kick[/i] a parcel through a doorway because she could not be bothered picking it up.

Consequently I am very careful to pack in solid boxes with plenty of padding, and expect the same from others. (I really don&#039;t like Randy&#039;s suggestion - sorry mate!). This increases mailing costs  but I think it is worth it- I hope anyone getting one of my parcels knows that the game has been well cared for, &quot;loved&quot; if you will, and this adds value for them. (OK, I&#039;m sentimental about my games).

The best cost reduction is through personal delivery - find someone going to Bordercon (or travelling interstate) and [-]foist the delivery on them[/-] ask if they will help. Pretty much everyone will do so if they have luggage space. This works equally well for games you are receiving, too.

When all the recipients are in the same city you may be able to send all the items together in one parcel. So long as they are happy to meet-up for distribution of the goodies, this works pretty well. (I&#039;m generally happy to distribute for people in Melbourne, btw).

Don&#039;t use Australia Post packing materials. They make a whacking big profit on the boxes and bubbles, but there is nothing special about them. I re-use boxes, packing peanuts, high density foam and bubblewrap. Make friends with someone in IT - the boxes used for computer parts are often perfect for games. 

Note that packages need to have a &quot;Aviation Security and Dangerous Goods Declaration Label&quot; or Australia Post will not accept them. This is preprinted on their boxes, but also available (free) as a sticker. [i]Except that my local post office has conveniently run out of them the last two times I was there.[/i] If you print and sign the following label, and stick it to the front of the box, you are OK (print it large - 24pt Arial is big enough) :

[q]AVIATION SECURITY AND DANGEROUS GOODS DECLARATION: THE SENDER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THIS ARTICLE MAY BE CARRIED BY AIR AND WILL BE SUBJECT TO AVIATION SECURITY AND CLEARING PROCEDURES; AND THE SENDER DECLARES THAT THE ARTICLE DOES NOT CONTAIN ANY DANGEROUS OR PROHIBITED GOODS, EXPLOSIVES OR INCENDIARY DEVICES. ARTICLES WITHOUT THIS DECLARATION COMPLETED WILL NOT BE CARRIED BY AIR. A FALSE DECLARATION IS A CRIMINAL OFFENCE. (NAME / SIGNATURE).
[size=7]
(p.38, [url=http://auspost.com.au/internationalpost/resources/pdf/post-guide-september-2009.pdf]here[/url])[/size][/q] 
But seriously. Come to Bordercon. [i]You know you want to...[/i] :cool:

This sounds like a pretty logical change Phil. But I&#039;ll have to differ to John as he is the brains behind the algorithms.

No worries Rob, I usually box my games with those foamy things from milsims because that&#039;s what I have laying around the office :thumbsup: .  But if you can bubble and box a game AND fit it in a pre-paid satchel, the savings is well worth it, especially if it goes to WA or QLD from the SE.

Does the &quot;no removal of item&quot; rule really mean that if I submit games to the list now, I&#039;m not allowed to accept any purchase or trade offers for them for the next 2-3 months prior to the running of the maths trade? If so, I&#039;m not sure this is encouraging the behaviour wanted. Given I&#039;m active in the marketplace and trade world, myself and anyone similar won&#039;t want to place games onto the list until the day prior to the running of the maths trade, in case we get offers before then.

The whole point of the maths trade is to encourage trades and game circulation. The maths trade encourages people to put up a whole bunch of games that weren&#039;t previously marked as &quot;for trade&quot;. If that triggers a trade beforehand, I reckon that&#039;s great! That helps achieve the goal. 

Does it really inconvenience people that much if the list gets modified and abbreviated before the running? You&#039;re not going to create your numbered want list until it&#039;s locked in anyway. If a game disappears that you were really after, that&#039;s the nature of the maths trade beast - you only one in a line of people who may have got it after all, there&#039;s no guarantees. Be happy for those who made a happy trade beforehand!

If you find a trade for a listed item then trade/sell it BUT edit the item to say so, leave the listing there and do not submit a trade wantlist for it. 
This way the geeklist does not get messed up. Never mind about the fact that this would only practically occur after the codes have been added. It is easier for a constant rule to be followed than one that changes at a certain time.

The whole point of the no-removal that is instituted here is so that people can start making want lists before the codes are entered. This was really good in January as there were so many items that it did take a day or two to go through the list properly

If items are removed, the numbers get screwed up and people can no longer keep track of what was on their list. Thus the &#039;no removal of item&#039; is all about not removing the place your entry has in the geeklist, not removing the item itself from trade. So you can put it up and trade it away or sell it, but change the geeklist item so that it says &quot;item sold&quot; in the description rather than completely removing the item, which screws up people&#039;s lists. That way everyone gets what they want.

Patrick, 3 word answer:

&quot;Blank Want List&quot;.

Heck, I could list WotR Collector&#039;s edition if I really wanted to.  But I&#039;d have to submit a Blank Want List as I don&#039;t fancy trying to buy a copy to trade away that which I do not own.  

Feel free to sell/trade any of your items that you list.  Just use courtesy and post &quot;Blank Want List as I no longer have the item.&quot;

That&#039;s sufficient.

The header does say...
[i]By posting an item to this list you are agreeing that you can mail it anywhere in Australia at your expense. If it looks like that&#039;s going to cost a lot, make sure you don&#039;t trade it for something crap.[/i]

If, as I did in the previous Maths trade, I offer cash, I expect that all parties to the trade will also do their best to minimise shipping charges which invariably means as the person offering the game for trade you will have some way of at least getting the game to BorderCon and as the person receiving the game you also would have some way of having it retrieved from BorderCon. 

That said, those trading games (either for other games or cash) and not coming to BorderCon, if they can indicate whether they are preferring (able) to ship via BorderCon network of participating gamers, that may assist others in their understanding. At the end of the day, the trade is open to all Australian based gamers and there is no requirement that any particular method of shipping is used except that the obligation remains with the owner of the game to find the method that works mutually for all parties. The sender is responsible for all costs and that is a listing condition.

The owner cash sell amount if included in the want list by the owner is what they are prepared to accept to clear the game out of their collection in the absence of any other suitable trade.

The receiver cash offer amount is what they are prepared to pay for a game, all inclusive of any shipping if the bid is matched in the maths trade.

I think it is fine because you can opt out of it if it doesn&#039;t interest you or confuses you. What we do need is a very clear write up by someone of how it works that is put in the main entry.

It may be worth having a discussion somewhere about how we should structure the trades in the future and whether there are things like cash, capped shipping, inclusion of other items, etc.

Is there anyone in Sydney (who is going to BorderCon) happy to be a mule to carry down a box of games to hand over to someone in the Melbourne contingent for me? 

(If there are multiple, I&#039;ll go with someone closest to St Ives.)

It just means that you know that no animals have been harmed in the testing of the game.

Apparently this sort of thing is common in some countries and many people object to it.

Why do people offering trades state whether they will be at Bordercon? Why does it matter?

(Other than the obvious, which is that it&#039;s going to be a great event with brilliant gamers from all over Australia. I&#039;m looking forward to it!)

Since everyone is responsible for shipping the games they&#039;re trading, why do the recipients care whether the sender (game giver/trader) is going to be at Bordercon? If the recipient is also going to be at Bordercon, then they can get the game there, admittedly. But, if not - or if they don&#039;t want to receive the game there (perhaps because their luggage allotment doesn&#039;t allow them to transport it back home) - then the original trader will still have to send it (which is no real concern of the recipient, who just has to receive the game).

So, if I list an item and state that I&#039;m going to be at Bordercon, am I just saying:
(1) &quot;I&#039;ll be happy if the recipient is also going to Bordercon, as that means I can transfer the game without having to pay postage. (And, if this game was obtained with a money trade, I&#039;ll still get the full amount; especially since the money probably is not coming from the recipient of this particular game.) But, if the recipient does not receive the game at Bordercon, I&#039;ll mail it like we always do and this will not bother you (the reader and possible recipient), unless it&#039;s unusually important to you that I am as happy as I can be (in which case you really should be sending me scads of money...).&quot;
AND
(2) &quot;Oh, by the way, if you are reading this and I obtain any of the games YOU are offering for trade, then you can probably save on postage if you are going to Bordercon, because I&#039;ll be there and can probably receive the games then.&quot;
?

So, I guess there&#039;s some data given. But it still seems a little strange to me that everyone is doing it. (Good for Bordercon, though, and that&#039;s a good thing.)

I think it is nice to know whether you can organize delivery without having to subsidise Australia Post (although you are probably correct - it is no one&#039;s business)...BTW...I will not be at BorderCon but I will be in Port Macquarie if you want to come down for the weekend.

So as a sender if indicating that you are plugging into the BorderCon network, either by attendance or way of sending your goods, recipients can also do their best to also plug in to assist you as the sender.

Clear as Mud, I think.

God will reward you - if not in this life then certainly in the next.

Can you believe that so many people leave it to the last minute to list items - pure madness.

P.S. Why are we sending our want lists to John - shouldn&#039;t we send them to you?     :(

Yeah, that would be nice, except I have the program which can tell me your mistakes, and I can get back to you straight away on what you&#039;ve got to fix. However I&#039;ll delegate hassling of late people to Neil.

In case anyone was wondering, this Aussie math trade is about average (in terms of number of items listed) for a mid-year Aussie wide trade.  The fewest was [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/42730/item/956828#item956828]250[/url] and the most was [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/30938/item/650230#item650230]576[/url] (from the very first Aussie maths trade).  This one is slighty larger than the mid-year maths trade last year which had [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/53341/item/1287424#item1287424]417[/url] items. 

EDIT: end of year trades get a few more entries.  The fewest being [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/35609/item/775344#item775344]367[/url] and the most being the last one with [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/61984/item/1528471#item1528471]670[/url].

[size=14][u]How to make your Want List[/u][/size]

Neil has asked that I regenerate this post from last time to assist new comers (and, presumably, old-comers who still can&#039;t get it right!) with help in building a Want List.

[size=8][i]NOTE: If you identify errors, omissions or suggestions for this post, I would appreciate it if you could please mail them to me and I will update the post rather than have multiple follow-on comments that may just confuse people. Of course, last time nobody at all complied with this request, but hope yields eternal optimism.[/i][/size]

[size=12][b]General guidelines[/b][/size]
You propose one of your items for one item (or one of a list of items) you would like in return; this includes cash offers and/or requests (covered below). TradeMaximizer works on the principle of getting [u]the most number of trades possible[/u].

The fundamental things to be aware of are that:
1) You can only ever get something you ask for in one of the lines of your Want List; and
2) You will only receive something if you manage to trade out your item, so the more items you have for each line on your Want List the more likely it is to get a successful trade for you; and
3) The trade works on one-item for one-item, but it does [u]not[/u] mean necessarily that the item you trade will go directly to the person you receive from. This is particularly relevant in cash trades, ie. the person you pay may not be the person sending you a game.

Accordingly, you need to make sure that [u]every item[/u] on your want list is a satisfactory trade for you (remembering that SENDER pays for shipping)... if you&#039;re not going to be content to receive a well-used Munchkin in return for your virgin copy of Queen&#039;s Gambit (including possibly paying postage to Christmas Island for it as well), then don&#039;t put it in.

John has detailed the ALGORITHM to be used, so that (in simple terms):
SCALED-PRIORITIES means that each of items [u]on each line[/u] is considered in order, with items appearing earlier being given higher priority for trade success than subsequent items. Thus, when creating each line for your submission, order the items you want in the order you most want them. However, the order of the rows in your list does not matter, and will not affect the trade probibilities.
ALLOW-DUMMIES provides the facility to use an [u]alias[/u] (covered below) where multiple copies of something are available, and you&#039;d be happy to receive one but not more than one.
REQUIRE-COLONS and REQUIRE-USERNAMES are formatting requirements that help reduce the possibility of errors when the engine runs.

A [u]Want List[/u] is a straight text file. It should not have formatting of any sort, but it should be structured correctly - this makes the Admin&#039;s life significantly easier. Each line (row) of your list should be structured in the same way.

[size=12][b]Starting the list[/b][/size]
Every item on the trade list has a designated trade code added to it in the format [b]###-TEXTS[/b], and you will need these for each item you want to put in your list.

Firstly, make a list of the games you are interested in receiving. How you do this is up to you; personally, I use a spreadsheet because I can review condition, sweeteners and other comments pretty quickly. Help for doing this is at [url]http://boardgamegeek.com/article/6049234#6049234[/url] (although you will need to change the Geeklist ID to 65650 for the current trade). You need the trade code for each item; a handy place to grab this is from Mr Lunch&#039;s excellent web list at [url]http://zincgames.com/sandpit/bgg-gl-list.php?glid=65650[/url].

Then make a list of any items you have added, [u]beginning each line with your username in brackets[/u] followed by a space, followed by the code for the item you have put up for trade [u]and a colon[/u]:
[COLOR=#0000FF]eg.
(ausminstrel) 365-BHILL:
(ausminstrel) 366-BBOWL:
(ausminstrel) 367-FALLN:
(ausminstrel) 368-DIPLO:
(ausminstrel) 369-DUELA:
(ausminstrel) 370-TRIUM:
[/COLOR]

[size=12][b]Dummies (Aliases)[/b][/size]
When building the list of items you want you will come across games that are listed multiple times. In the likely circumstance that you are not one of those people who wants, for example, three copies of Race for the Galaxy (yes, there are people like that!!), you can create a dummy (an alias). This allows you to add the game in more than one line, but the trade engine will only find one success for it, so you can only receive one copy!

The same functionality can also be used to build a selection of games where they are not the all same and you would be happy to receive any one (and only one) of them.

To create an alias, create a name for it; this can be anything you like, but it must be unique in your list and it must be preceded a % sign. And, as with any other row on your list, the start of each line must be your username surrounded by brackets and it must have a colon after the submitted item code.

Do this for each game you want where you want only one from the selection.
[COLOR=#0000FF]eg.
(ausminstrel) %CARCS:
(ausminstrel) %CAYLU:
(ausminstrel) %WGAME:
[/COLOR]

Then, next to each alias, put the trade code for the items you want. As with a normal want list, these should be in order of preference (for example, you might want to put a version listed as &quot;new&quot; ahead of one listed as &quot;good&quot;, but you&#039;d be happy to get either).

[COLOR=#0000FF]eg.
(ausminstrel) %CARCS: 005-CARCA 252-CCITY 253-CARCC
(ausminstrel) %CAYLS: 296-CAYLU 263-KLUSS 222-KLUUS
(ausminstrel) %WGAME: 347-STRUG 398-DOOOM 287-ASLSK 372-PATON 
[/COLOR]

[size=12][b]Trading games for games[/b][/size]
Now, to each row of the list of games you submitted, add codes for any of the games you would be happy to receive in trade, leaving a space between each one. You may have items in more than one line (ie. you would trade any of several of your items for a particular item). Where you are adding a game used in your alias list, [u]use the alias code rather than the individual item code[/u].

As noted above, you may be required to pay postage to anywhere in the country, so bear that in mind at all times when deciding what you&#039;d be happy to receive in return.

Also remember that the TradeMaximizer will weigh trades earlier in the row as more desirable than those later, so prioritise.

[COLOR=#0000FF]eg.
(ausminstrel) 365-BHILL: %CAYLS 364-TBAGO 
(ausminstrel) 366-BBOWL: 364-TBAGO %CAYLS %WGAME 
(ausminstrel) 367-FALLN: 364-TBAGO 384-FLIPR  
(ausminstrel) 368-DIPLO: 364-TBAGO 384-FLIPR 359-BTROL 
(ausminstrel) 369-DUELA: %CARCS
(ausminstrel) 370-TRIUM: %WGAME 364-TBAGO 
[/COLOR]

Trades work one-for-one, so one offer on each line gets matched against one possible item. Thus, 364-TBAGO appearing on four rows can obviously only trade once, for one of my items. (Incidentally, this means that if it trades once and there are no other options for my other items, my other items won&#039;t trade... the more items you are prepared to trade for each of yours, the more likely you are to get them all traded!)

Also, alias items only trade once; so, my 366-BBOWL might trade for 364-TBAGO or a copy of CAYLUS (in which case nothing else would trade for anything from my %CAYLS list) or from WGAME (in which case nothing else would trade from my %WGAME list).

[size=12][b]Trading cash[/b][/size]
You are also able to use CASH as an option in this trade, allowing contributors to both offer cash in trade for an item, and/or accept cash as a suitable trade.

If you are happy to accept cash for one of your submissions, simply add the amount to the relevant row of your want list.
[COLOR=#0000FF]eg.
(ausminstrel) 369-DUELA: %CARCS $25
[/COLOR]

If you want to offer cash for one or more items, add it as a row as you would a game, remembering correct syntax for the row: your username in brackets, offer, colon, items.
[COLOR=#0000FF]eg.
(ausminstrel) $40: 388-TOLDO
[/COLOR]

[i]Bear in mind that [u]there is not necessarily a correlation between the amount you offer and the amount requested[/u] for any particular item. Because the methodology of a maths trade is not A &amp;lt;--&amp;gt; B, but may be A --&amp;gt; B --&amp;gt; C --&amp;gt; A (or even more complex), you could conceivably offer more or less for an item than the person requests and still end up with a successful trade. You can also make cash offers for items not submitted with a value and get a successful trade.[/i]

However, the simple rule to remember is that trades can only be matched against the items on each row of your list... if you offer something (cash or game) you can only receive respective items you specify (be they cash or game). You cannot possibly end up with a trade you have not requested.

You can also use a CASH offer to try for one item from a selection of several using the alias functionality, exactly as with any other trade.
[COLOR=#0000FF]eg.
(ausminstrel) %PORNO: 071-ROMEQ 070-STEEL 051-FLOOD 016-KILLR 
(ausminstrel) $20: %PORNO
[/COLOR]

John has also created code that allows you to specify an overall spending limit, so that the [u]sum[/u] of any possible trades will not exceed that limit. Use LIMIT as the code and the same syntax...
[COLOR=#0000FF]eg.
(ausminstrel) LIMIT: $60
[/COLOR]

[size=12][b]Finishing off[/b][/size]
When you&#039;re done, put it all together and check your syntax: [u]every line[/u] needs to
:1vp: start with your username (in brackets), and
:1vp: have a row identifier (alias name, item code, offer or limit), followed by
:1vp: a colon, and then
:1vp: a list of acceptable trade items (code, alias and/or amount).

[COLOR=#0000FF]eg.
(ausminstrel) %CARCS: 005-CARCA 252-CCITY 253-CARCC
(ausminstrel) %CAYLS: 296-CAYLU 263-KLUSS 222-KLUUS
(ausminstrel) %WGAME: 347-STRUG 398-DOOOM 287-ASLSK 372-PATON 
(ausminstrel) %PORNO: 071-ROMEQ 070-STEEL 051-FLOOD 016-KILLR 
(ausminstrel) 365-BHILL: 364-TBAGO %CAYLS 
(ausminstrel) 366-BBOWL: 364-TBAGO %CAYLS %WGAME 
(ausminstrel) 367-FALLN: 364-TBAGO
(ausminstrel) 368-DIPLO: 364-TBAGO 384-FLIPR 359-BTROL 
(ausminstrel) 369-DUELA: %CARCS $25
(ausminstrel) 370-TRIUM: %WGAME 364-TBAGO 
(ausminstrel) $40: 388-TOLDO
(ausminstrel) $50: 068-PANZA 
(ausminstrel) $20: %PORNO
(ausminstrel) LIMIT: $60
[/COLOR]

Thus...
For 365-BHILL, I may receive 364-TBAGO or one of the CAYLS items, but if I get TBAGO then 367-FALLN cannot trade, or if I get a CAYLS item then no other items from the CAYLS list can be received.
For 369-DUELA I may receive something from the CARCS list or $25.
I may pay (up to) $40 for 388-TOLDO or $50 for 068-PANZA (regardless of how much the contributor requests for it) or $20 from something from the PORNO list, but I will not get all of them if this would exceed my designated spending LIMIT of $60.


When you&#039;re done, copy it into a Geekmail and sent to [user=Friendless][/user] Do not send it to Neil [SoccerGeeks F.C.]

[b]It may be conducive to your karma to thank both Neil and John, as running maths trades is a difficult and time consuming job and, apart from the glory, kudos, opportunity to publicly mock Geeks who cannot follow simple instructions, and whatever riches they manage to surreptitiously extract from somewhere, they don&#039;t get much else from the experience.[/b]

I hope this helps some of you.

Has created a spreadsheet listing all items + sweeteners for your easy list creating pleasure.

Each item also contains a hyperlink so you can see what the heck it is on BGG if you are not aware already.

Really nice stuff - All Code Items and owners are also listed so it should make finding that info for Trade Lists easy as...I will still cock it up though. :p

If you would like a copy please e-mail me and I will send it through. (1.07 MB uses MS Excel 2003)

Ok punters here is a link to a list from John that will make you cry with joy or make you shriek in frustration.

John&#039;s AI and my outdated typewriter are having trouble talking to one another for a Geek based list of what went where (his AI didn&#039;t bring flowers so my typewriter got snooty methinks) but John will get something up in good time that is BGG viewable.

Until then this list will give you the lowdown. Me happy! :D

I think good practice is to contact recipients to see if any Games Mules are in play to help with postage but if not get them off to your targets in good time.

Hope the trade went well. I didn&#039;t screw up too much...I may do it again in January if no one objects.

So by my count that makes a 53% trade rate.

But that is on total items...and not taking into account items that were removed/sold before the Trade List period.

Anyone care to work that out?

Sorry if this is confusing, with cash trades do we send the money directly to the person we are getting the game from?

Or do we look at the trading loops and give it to someone else in the loop?

In your case: 

[q]
FinalAttack

FinalAttack sends:
$20 from FinalAttack to nnf1
Entry 102: The Settlers of Catan (102-CATAN) to Thiessi
Entry 103: Puerto Rico (103-PRICO) to gerald
$35 from FinalAttack to Unhalfbricking

FinalAttack receives:
Entry 129: Hive (129-BUZZZ) from Lucky Phil
Entry 261: Arkham Horror (261-CTHLU) from wilderness
Entry 27: Summoner Wars: Phoenix Elves vs Tundra Orcs (027-SUMON) from goonahboy
Entry 425: Monsterpocalypse (425-MNSTA) from nnf1

These games do not trade:
Tomb
Nexus Ops
BattleLore: Heroes Expansion
Space Hulk: Death Angel - The Card Game
Dungeon Twister
Catan: Traders &amp; Barbarians
Carcassonne: Hunters and Gatherers

FinalAttack:
receives Entry 129: Hive (129-BUZZZ) in exchange for $20 from FinalAttack
receives Entry 261: Arkham Horror (261-CTHLU) in exchange for Entry 102: The Settlers of Catan (102-CATAN)
receives Entry 27: Summoner Wars: Phoenix Elves vs Tundra Orcs (027-SUMON) in exchange for Entry 103: Puerto Rico (103-PRICO)
receives Entry 425: Monsterpocalypse (425-MNSTA) in exchange for $35 from FinalAttack
[/q]

It looks like you send money ($20) to nnf1 and send money ($35) to Unhalfbricking.

I&#039;ve been slammed this past month and having a tough time getting to a post office during opening hours, I&#039;m trying for today.

I haven&#039;t received ffish&#039;s address to send his game to and he hasn&#039;t replied to messages, any chance anyone else has it?

In case people are subscribed to this and not the other thread, there is a poll going for how we should arrange postage costs for the next maths trade:

	<body>NOTE: this has not been released yet.  I am listing this assuming it will be available in time to trade at Bordercon (whether I end up there or not - I&#039;m trying to make it happen).  It is due to be published in May.  If you put this on your want list you do so accepting that it may be delayed - you know how game publish dates often get pushed back.  

The recipent of this game will get it in the condition that I get it - that is in shrink and with the preorder bonus.
[-]
If I don&#039;t end up going to BC I&#039;ll send it along with someone who will be.[/-]

I will be at BC!


[b]Update:[/b]  Rules are online [url=http://tastyminstrelgames.com/rules/eminent-domain-rulebook.pdf]here[/url]. Look closely in the supporters section and you can see a whole bunch of familiar Aussie names.

[b]This update has just been posted with news of additional cards:[/b]

&quot;Good news for our faithful supporters! 

Not only will you be getting your games, in some cases limited edition copies (the digital signatures look AWESOME by the way) and the promo Prestige planets, but we&#039;ve decided to also give you a set of 6 Utopian planets as well! These Utopian planets were going to be a pre-order incentive for the preview nights, but we thought you guys should get them too, so we combined the Utopian planets and Prestige planets into 1 mini-expansion. It made much more sense to package all 9 of those cards together, so both [b]supporters[/b] and Preview Night pre-orders [b]will get a 9-card pack inside each game box[/b], free of charge! People who missed out on the Kickstart AND the Preview Nights will have to buy those planets separately if they want them.&quot;

[COLOR=#FF0000][b]UPDATE 2: [/b][/COLOR] I&#039;ve contacted TMG to see when they think they will have this.  Seth (the designer) replied very promptly to say that he thought it they would be receiving it in early June and that he very much doubted that Aussie&#039;s who have ordered it will get it by then.  So from this I take it that I (and other Aussie&#039;s who&#039;ve ordered it) won&#039;t have it until late June.  This of course means that I won&#039;t be able to deliver it (or play it) at BorderCon.  [b]Remember: if you put this on your want list you may have to wait for it! [/b]

Really sorry about the delays :(

The pre-press stuff is wrapping up and the game should be starting to physically go to print within a week. I really would have liked to see the final product by now, but what can you do. At least I can fall back on the fact that the game looks terrific, is lots of fun, and that the expansion (under construction) will be going out to print and play testers &quot;any minute now&quot;!

This is the version pictured (brown box). The set is [u]Complete[/u] and in [u]Good Condition[/u]. As far as I can tell, the player shields have never been assembled and the players-aid pad seems full. The box is in excellent condition for a 30yo game.

Cash offers must exceed $100
(Although I can&#039;t really see myself accepting a cash trade. I prefer games)

Whoever receives this in trade must be prepared to post a suitably awesome quote from the book (but not the movie, although it may be accompanied by an image from the movie for emphasis) in one of the forums for this Math Trade.</body>

Not really. You can only have a lower offer for local pickup if it is accepted pre-trade. Once the trade happens you can only set one amount of money regardless of where it goes, which makes it a bit of a lottery as to how much you get (but it has to be this way as often the money you pay for a game heads to a third party).

Good catch! I don&#039;t think this can be done, because the money received may come from another trade than the one involving this game.

Say:
- Peter will trade D:A for $40
- Q will trade Carc for D:A
- R will trade $40 for Carc

The longest trade chain is:
- Peter gives D:A to Q
- Q gives Carc to R
- R gives $40 to Peter.

Peter does receive $40 for his D:A, but it&#039;s not a 1-to-1 trade, so if Q picks up D:A locally, Q is not the one giving the money for it and therefore will not save anything.

I guess Q could be nice and do it just so that someone (R) has to pay less, but it could get messy to manage!

Not as a part of the maths trade but yes if you arrange a sale with someone directly. Listed items MUST be kept for the maths trade results if you submit a tradelist for them. You can sell any games that you list to anyone who makes an offer you are happy with and submit a blank tradelist for that game.

I will not be at bordercon but if this trades I will try and arrange for a kindly Canberran to take it for me, otherwise post.

Up for trade is GMT Games &quot;Wellington&quot;. I love Card-driven Wargames but the time to play them has pretty much gone (well at least for another 10 years or so!). The game is in excellent condition and cards were sleeved for play.

One assumes that &quot;were sleeved&quot; means that you have since unsleeved them.

Dear Captain Obvious (if that really is your name),

The structure of his sentence is clumsy but I think he actually means &quot;have been sleeved&quot; or perhaps even &quot;are sleeved, ready for play.&quot;

But I think he should be congratulated for making it abundantly clear that he is not going to BorderCon.

Yep, he just said they were sleeved, he didn&#039;t say they were subsequently unsleeved. I&#039;m sure if Adam is going to trade any games in which cards have been unsleeved, he&#039;ll be explicit about it.

In fact, he may be rather explicit towards Meng and me after he reads this.

oh yes...there was some sign language in there for Meng and Friendless but probably not the ones you were referring to. You had to read really hard between the lines to get it (but not literally so).

P.S. Just to be explicit - the cards are unsleeved :D

Yes...they are pet-free, however, I let my eldest son lick each of the cards before putting them into to the sleeve. I found that it stops the cards from moving around too much. ;)

	<body>[COLOR=#FF0066][size=18]I have too many games.[/size][/COLOR]

There are a lot of good games in this bundle - don&#039;t think of them as sweeteners - I just want to downsize my collection.

Plus:

[thing=301][/thing] - see my review for details
[ImageID=9934]

[thing=85510][/thing] (Deluxe edition) - see my review for details - print and play game - I made it and it looks good - christmas game for four players - quick and good fun
[ImageID=842015]

[thing=1263][/thing] by Michael Schacht - dice game
[ImageID=65202]

[thing=13823][/thing] - card game
[ImageID=169916]

[thing=24770][/thing] by Michael Schacht - card game
[ImageID=247758]

[thing=398][/thing] by Reiner Knizia - excellent card game - fast and fun - highly recommended
[ImageID=195746]

[thing=116][/thing] - nasty card game for four players
[ImageID=143139]

[thing=170][/thing] - nasty card game for up to six players - player elimination - fun
[ImageID=178922]

[thing=42132][/thing]
[ImageID=467520]


Given the retail cost of these items the price would have to be $110 but I think I would really like a trade.

I won&#039;t be at Bordercon - but that may change.

Great game and I&#039;m sorry to let this go, but I need space for Rallyman which is going to be played more that this has. It&#039;s in great condition.

This has been discussed numerous times already.  By agreeing to participate in the trade YOU agree to pay the post.  

[q]By posting an item to this list you are agreeing that you can mail it anywhere in Australia at your expense. If it looks like that&#039;s going to cost a lot, make sure you don&#039;t trade it for something crap.[/q]

You can&#039;t specify &quot;user pays postage&quot; at all.  If you happen to trade with someone in Perth, that&#039;s just bad luck.

Ticket to ride is not one of my favorite games, but this version is not that bad. It adds passengers to the classic and the map is for Germany. Played once and it&#039;s in great condition.

Craig&#039;s right - you can&#039;t specify that the recipient pays postage (see last item).

If you are worried about postage costs then increase the amount you are willing to sell for to incorporate those possible costs.

I have made the game and it looks quite good - the photo is not of the game that I have made. You still need to supply your own Pyreeples to play the game.

OK, you&#039;re on.  I&#039;ll take the $60.  You can do my household chores and have a 10 minute rest on my knee.  But I have to insist... ONLY the knee.

What time can I expect you?  Not too late tonight please, I need to get up early for work in the morning.

A punched, unplayed copy of Battles of Westeros. I have glued the miniatures to their bases (fun, fun...) so it is ready for play. I just have not got this to the table (a pity since I love the books) so I thought I would throw it up for trade.

The corners of the lid are torn and the bottom of the box is somewhat creased. The molded plastic interior casing is somewhat bent, but retains its structural integrity. 

Not sure which edition this is. At the back of the rules, it says:

I imagine there is such a game almost all the time. I just thought about the maths for a moment and realised that it&#039;s not required. In fact, because rankings come from &quot;Geek Ratings&quot;, which are different to average ratings, it&#039;s actually possible there can be multiple. Look how many games there are with an average rating of 6.53:

http://boardgamegeek.com/browse/boardgame/page/402?sort=avgrating

As the geek average and the average rating are somewhat the same, I further hypothesize that the occurrences occur at about that ranking, and so they&#039;re well-known games.

well, my thought is that as rank increases numerically, the average rating decreases.  So, if graphed the two numbers would cross somewhere, but only at one point (and possibly not at all, as it&#039;s possible for game 653 to have a rating of 6.54 and game 654 to have a rating of 6.53).  

So this game currently stands at this crux.

Randy, because the y axis is discrete, there&#039;s not guaranteed to be an exact match. For example, number 700 could be rated 7.01 and number 701 could be rated 7.00. Also note that because the 6.53 is an average rating, and rankings are made from BGG averages, one of your lines is actually more of a cloud rather than a line.

Please ignore the unwashed rabble gasping in awe as we do science.

Unwashed rabble (quick... whilst they aren&#039;t looking).  I implore you all to please go in and over-rate this game so it jumps up 1 in the rankings and stops this whole conversation dead in the water.  

That&#039;ll fix &#039;em.  :ninja:

[q=&quot;GeneSteeler&quot;]well, my thought is that as rank increases numerically, the average rating decreases.  So, if graphed the two numbers would cross somewhere, but only at one point (and possibly not at all, as it&#039;s possible for game 653 to have a rating of 6.54 and game 654 to have a rating of 6.53).  

So this game currently stands at this crux.

Apparently this can happen; even if the game is pet-free, smoke-free, sleeved, vaccinated, encased in perspex, handled with gloves, manipulated with tweezers, swaddled in felt, blessed by a bishop, consecrated by a rabbi, endorsed by a mufti, approved by the Office of Film and Television Certification, wrapped in the caul of a first-born child,  certified GM-free, and contains no traces of nuts.

I do not think it works like an auction Julian. If people want to buy this they will offer $40 and hope they are the chosen one. Those who offer more for the bundle do not have a greater chance of getting them so it does not make sense that anyone will (except those who think you deserve more)

It allows you to potentially win other lots at a higher price instead.

Julian if you&#039;re more interested in selling them, you should put them all in separate entries.

Probably a good decision, but it was the best looking item up for trade so far - I am bitterly disappointed.

And yes...the items so far are not as exciting as has been the case previously.

Personally, I hold Neil Thomson responsible.

I agree, but he did have the foresight to give us another month yet to add items to the list. This has come very hot on the heels of the previous trade, and I haven&#039;t played some of those games yet. Also, as the last trade was quite successful, we may have achieved a lot of the trades that were possible. 

I actually liked the look of Julian&#039;s items - at least they were different - so I hope they come back in separate entries.

[q=&quot;djcassar&quot;]Here is how I understand it:

Tim offers game X for $70 OR for game Y
John offers game Y at $75

You offer ?upto? $80 for game X

John recieves $75 from you - John is happy
Tim recieves game Y (its been paid for by you) - Tim is happy
You recieve game X (having paid $75 for it, not $70)
[/q]

John and Tim are happy...how about you...just curious.

[q=&quot;Dr Corey&quot;]Your $80 is treated as a fixed amount for the algorithm.[/q]

Sorry, not really true. You&#039;re able to win a $20 game with your $80 bid, in which case you will only pay the $20. The guy receiving the $20 gets what he wanted, you can keep the $60 and you get whatever you offered $80 for. The principle is if there are to be surprises, they should be nice ones for everyone.

It&#039;s only at the very last moment, when I figure out how much you have to pay, that the amount is decided, and it&#039;s lowered to match the seller.

One of the settings we use, for hysterical reasons, favours long loops. I wouldn&#039;t mind if dumped that one.

You may well presume that, but there are only 2/12 tiles with river on them, so I doubt it. The River expansion is included in the &#039;First Expansion&#039; also known a Inns &amp; Cathedrals, as far as I remember.

What Sacha says. Julian, I added an empty want list for it on your behalf, saying that you wouldn&#039;t accept anything for it. That makes the program happy, and that&#039;s why the entry went out of the list.

That is true, but bringing it to their attention might give them a chance to rejig their list.

No need to. They already listed ALL the games they would want in the tradelists for ALL the games they want to trade... if they understand the process that is.

In some of the MTs I ran some punters forgot about some of their items and only submitted lists for them when I contacted them personally...it does happen.

This is one of mine. It does have a CD (unused). There is an English translation of the rules, if you are unable to download them from the Geek.

I was going to sit out of this maths trade since I do not have many games that I want to trade. This is one sweet bundle of games though. Maybe I need to join in after all.

If only I&#039;d known that unhalfbricking had a copy of balloon cup available. I have been looking for a copy of this game for a while

Alas, it is too late to get in on the math trade (and I don&#039;t need race as we already have it)

Yes. Since purchasing Ra, this doesn&#039;t get played as much, besides which the EGF has a club copy.

Chris, unfortunately you cannot stipulate a variable price (ie. plus postage of $X), as the person who pays to you the money may not (in fact, probably will not) be the person who receives the game.

For the same reason, nor can you add a sweetener that is conditional.

If you are going to submit your trade list with a value then it needs a finite amount on it, and you if you include a sweetener with your trade offer then you are obligated to include it, whether or not it trades for money or anything else.

	<body>The original AH game from 1980. It is complete AFAIK. The box is bowed badly and has a couple of bad corner splits. The rules are fine, it has the original 2d6 and the counters are unpunched.

See Neil, your lack of photographic memory has let you down here.  You used CUTCA for the item at 007 and CCAVE for this one.

[q=&quot;trif&quot;][q=&quot;tiggers&quot;][q=&quot;trif&quot;]Getting rid of it already? Have you tried selling it to Gitmo?[/q]

Yeah well I do have two other Ubongo games already.  The differences weren&#039;t enought to warrant keeping.

BTW what is a gitmo?

I was aware that gitmo was short for Guantanamo Bay I just failed to see the relevance.  Now with the context of your torture whilst playing it, your comment makes more sense.

	<body>This is another excellent game. I now have the L2 edition and am unlikely to play this one again.

Included is [thing=4686][/thing] which is a substantial expansion to the game with its own map and extra counters. I really am not very much into expansions and this one really needs the AH edition of the game for the counters to all be compatible.

No. Sometimes it can be cathartic to let people know that even I have some bad games. (Present from my sister&#039;s family who live in Portsmouth &amp; obviously thought I&#039;d want it!)

The box is only used to store the components - it doesn&#039;t actually detract from the playing of the game...to the best of my knowledge.

Hi Greg,

Thanks for your feedback - much appreciated. I sense you&#039;re awaiting an explanation why I&#039;m asking only $70 for a game you can buy new for $82.50 from Milsims, (when they get it back in stock) plus postage.

The price reflects the need to add postage - which to Perth for this game could be $15 or so, or maybe $12 to Melbourne. I have the game for sale for $15 less in the marketplace ($55), which I feel is a very attractive price if you can pick it up from me or a local gaming group.

The game pieces are in as new condition. The box is in lovely condition with no dents or scuff marks - except two nicely taped up box edges. If you&#039;re not a collector you might happily not care about the non pristine condition of the box.

If you have any questions about a game, want to make an offer, or whisper sweet nothings in my ear then feel free to PM me. Or, if you just want to dis on my games you could continue to do that right here in the comments too.

Plus:

[GAMEID=40210]

Purchased base game plus first expansion together and played only solitaire. Shortly after bought second expansion to play solitaire possibly several dozen times, so wear on cards only starting to show along edge. 

Noticeable wear along top edges on both player action tokens and credit marker (solitaire components), as well as little shelf wear on base game box. Otherwise all contents and boxes are in excellent condition.

And I won&#039;t be at Bordercon.

All the cool people are coming. I of course invalidate that with the exception that I am not coming given that I am already here.

I&#039;ve actually been to Bordercom - in 2006 and 2008. Or was it still AGE then?

2006 was still AGE but 2008 may have been the 1st BorderCon Year that I took the reins. Names largely escaped me then...:blush:

I don&#039;t understand how it can be in &quot;mint&quot; condition if it has been played twice.

Do you mean &quot;minced&quot; condition?

Definitely not a shortage of Nexus Ops fans.  I love the game, so much I picked up extra copies when it was on sale.  Totally worth it.  Great generally, but fairest 3 player war game ever.

[/q]

Yes and no.

There is still an abundant surplus. But that surplus is in the hands of consumers now.

Everybody and their brother seems to have copies still in shrink, yet no one wants to trade them. I assume that they think they are going to put their kids through college or something with their miserly holding of a shrink wrapped copy of nexus ops. I have no clue.

So it is sort of a grail game, but only because the market value is inflated artificially due to hoarding. At least in the states.

Up until fairly recently Jedko/Milsims had a surplus of copies due to a clerical error made by their distributor. IIRC, several years ago they ordered 20 copies and received 200. It was cheaper for the distributor to pay for warehousing (at Jedko) than to have them returned. In 2009 I bought one for a friend for $15.

The latter has no box and the components have been packed with the base game. The cards for both the game and the expansion show a little wear but the game is otherwise in very good condition.

It is.  As a bonus it comes from a pet free, non-smoking home.  It&#039;s just really hard getting the sleeves on the blocks though.

Sleeving pets solves all sorts of problems.

David is a pirate, so of course he&#039;s dethpicable.  Those guys would sell anything for the right price.  You ever wonder why so many of them have hooks instead of hands?

Honestly, who else would sell a hundred dollar game for just sixty-five (including postage).

I almost wish I didn&#039;t have the game so that I could take advantage of an offer like this.

I&#039;ll buy your copy off you for $5 (including postage) and then you are free to try for this.  Sounds like a win-win to me.

So you have the Dutch version of the American game and the English version of a Dutch game...  Wouldn&#039;t that make more sense the other way around?

Are you supposed to put a price on it rather than just say &#039;for sale&#039;?

Let me know if that&#039;s part of the rules but I haven&#039;t made up my mind yet &amp; I was going to decide when I submit my want list.

Due to the nature of the maths trade algorithm I don&#039;t think it&#039;s that important.  For example, you can definitely offer $ for games that are &quot;not for sale&quot; - you&#039;ll just end up as part of a trade loop where you pay a different person (who was happy to accept cash for their game) than the one you receive the game from.  Setting a price for a game just means that&#039;s the most the payer will give you (even though you may not be sending the game to the payer).

I&#039;ll be away for the weekend - leaving in a few minutes - but I can sort it out next week if that&#039;s important.

You are better off putting up a price and sticking to it (or requesting under it) as then it is more likely to be sold, but there is no requirement to do so.

[q=&quot;coxy_fc&quot;]Are you supposed to put a price on it rather than just say &#039;for sale&#039;?[/q]There is no obligation to specify the price beyond including it in your wish list. The trade maximiser will work well enough with overbids potentially helping the person offering the game get a trade for something on their list.

e.g. 
A wants B for $40
B wants C for $30
C wants $40 for the offering they have.

A gets B and sends $40 to C
B gets C
C gets $40 and sends C to B.

A is happy as they got the game they wanted at the price they were prepared to pay. B is happy as they got the game at the price they were prepared to pay. C is happy as they got the money for the game which they were asking.

Ben, the advantage of mentioning the price is that people will know to offer that much. If they guess, they might get guess $5 below what you say.

How does an item like this go for compatability to an older version of the game?

I&#039;ve got this and the older 3rd edition of Settlers.  All the hexes are the same size so it fits in pretty easily with the old version.  The only thing that you can&#039;t use is part of the outer perimeter board that came with the fourth edition.

Yeah, they slot together fine.  I do the same thing.  Card is made from a lighter material though I think.

	<body>1999 Edition. Never been played, although it has been moved a lot, so the box has some wear around the corners.

This is the version with awesome metal miniatures - however, one ship is missing :( There is also two flag markers missing, but the game is still perfectly playable.

I won&#039;t be at BC, but Simon has kindly offered to take games down for me (thanks Simon!).

[q=&quot;Tezza&quot;]This version has yellow houses?  What does that mean to the uninformed?[/q]

Not much. The original game came with natural houses instead of yellow.

I gave away my copy with the natural to my son and bought myself a replacement with the yellow.

It just came as an unpleasant change and I am still looking to become more natural.

I got this about 15-20 years ago, but I had no-one to play boardgames with back then.

It has been played 3-4 times and is in very good condition. Small amounts of edge wear on box, thats about it. Board and components all still in great condition.

	<body>Card game where players are recruiting goblins from five different clans - each with different powers - to fight in their army for the Great Battle.  It&#039;s similar in feel to Magic: The Gathering, but definitely a different game and it&#039;s NOT a CCG (that is, you get ALL the cards in the box).

Condition:  The top of the box has a dent and a tear, though it does not affect the function of the box at all.  The bottom of the box has a slight dent.  Otherwise, everything is in excellent condition.  (The game was carefully played a couple of times).

$35 to buy or I&#039;ll see what I can trade it for.  (If you want to lock this in for yourself, contact me and buy it from me before I submit my trade list...)

I&#039;ll be at Bordercon!

-------

The description from Milsims:

The Goblins hordes are on the warpath!

GOSU lets you build your very own goblin army, then face off against other goblin warlords. Discover powerful combos and unleash your horde on your opponents! Trap and destroy enemy goblins, while mutating your less useful goblins into more powerful units. GOSU has strategy, tactics, and a big heap of fun.

Features:

* Eye-catching artwork
* Lots of combos and tactics to explore
* High replay value
* Excelent fit for CCG players looking for something different</body>

	<body>Excellent cooperative card game where the players are Space Marines attempting to accomplish various Missions in a space hulk filled with Genestealers.  It captures the Space Hulk experience very well.
