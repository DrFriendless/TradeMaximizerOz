<title>Australia-wide Maths Trade #2 - Results Posted!</title>
<description>This is the [-]first[/-] second of what will hopefully be many Aussie maths trades.

Once you&#039;ve added an item to the list, don&#039;t delete it. Submit a blank want list if you want to withdraw a game.

You can edit items to add more info, but please don&#039;t change the game or remove sweeteners when you do so. Adding in more sweeteners is fine.

Discussion, including explanations of mechanisms, requests for games, etc., can take place in the companion discussion thread.

By posting an item to this list you are agreeing that you can [u]mail it anywhere in Australia at your expense[/u]. If it looks like that&#039;s going to cost a lot, make sure you don&#039;t trade it for something crap.

[b]Specific Rules:[/b]
This trade is open to Australian BGGers only.

This trade is open to board games, expansions, card games, game accessories, and the like. Please don&#039;t add anything else. That means no cash, no geekgold, no buffy DVDs etc.

[b]Limits:[/b]
Feel free to put as many items on the list as you want. Duplicates of items already on the list are okay. You can combine multiple games into one item (e.g. Carcassonne plus expansions).

Please describe the edition, language, and condition of the game. Pick a picture that represents the game you&#039;re offering if there are multiple versions. If necessary, take a picture of the game, upload it to your gallery, and use that image.

Please count pieces to make sure the games are complete, and accurately list any components that are missing or damaged.

In order to make your items more (or less) appealing, you may want to add one or more &quot;sweeteners&quot; to the item listing -- an expansion, a related game, or a completely unrelated item that you think will make it a more desirable package.

Items for which there is no BGG listing can be listed as Miscellaneous Game Accessory.

[b]Algorithm:[/b]
Trade lists will be found by TradeMaximizer using SCALED-PRIORITIES, ALLOW-DUMMIES, REQUIRE-COLONS and REQUIRE-USERNAMES switches.

[b]Deadlines:[/b]
Add items to the list by: 8pm Friday October 24.
Official item list posted by: 8pm Monday October 27.
Want Lists Due By: 8pm Friday October 31.
Official Results Posted By: Monday November 3.

[b]Format:[/b]
The official item list will be of a format something like:
001-TWIXT
002-BMOON
003-PUERT
004-TICHU

Want lists must be submitted in a format like

(sbszine) 001-TWIXT : 004-TICHU 002-BMOON

indicating that sbszine, the person who put item 001, a Twixt game, into the list would be willing to accept either item 004, a Tichu game, or item 002, Blue Moon, in trade for it. The order of listing is your order of preference, in case both trades are possible.

The order of wants is a tiebreaker only. The system will first try to maximise the number of trades, even if this means that you get your last preference. The order of your wants will only be considered if there are multiple ways to get the maximum trades. But, fear not! You will never get a game that is not on your want list.

If you put 5 games on this trade list, you will be submitting 5 different want lists. Details will be in the discussion thread: [url]http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/346150[/url].

The last one of these we did it took ages to go through the GeekList to figure out what I wanted. So, I hacked together a [url=http://zincgames.com/sandpit/bgg-xmlapi.php?glid=35609]PHP page to read the XMLAPI for it[/url]. It does very little (if any -- I can&#039;t remember) error checking and there may have been some changes (read &#039;bugs&#039;) introduced to the API since I did it. YMMV.

What the hell. Enjoy.

This is great, I enjoyed the last maths trade and I got Runebound out of it, which I enjoy immensely and has got heaps of plays. Bring it on!

Guys, if you add a sweetener please include a picture of it in your item so it&#039;s really obvious what&#039;s included.

Hi 

I sent through my want list on Monday 27th October in a Geekmail.

I&#039;ve sent it on again.

Thanks again for organising this

Aaron, if you include a picture of Giza like I&#039;ve done below for GIPF it will be more obvious it&#039;s included, as well as being easier to identify as to who it&#039;s for when it turns up in a box at sbszine&#039;s house.

Hi John,

Yeah I tried to do that but couldn&#039;t figure out the code.

Take 2: pretty easy to figure out actually :blush:

	<body>Loved the idea and intrigue of this game but our gaming tastes soon changed and as such it has never been played . Has been opened - in excellent condition .
(P.S. My 12 year-old better not see this as she has been hankering to play it ever since it was purchased 18 months ago . Maybe I should feel guilty if it is spirited away in a trade ...)</body>

What&#039;s the serial number on this Elfenroads? I&#039;ve got a copy but that&#039;s getting worn out. Wouldn&#039;t mind a &#039;new&#039; one...

On the back of the box it is marked as #32 (I think), I&#039;ll get back to you when I get home.

	<body>This copy is nearly 20 years old so be ready for that, but IMHO for that age it&#039;s in excellent condition. The miniatures are still whole, the cards are a bit warped but otherwise very good, and all of the other stuff looks good. There&#039;s a price sticker on the lid. I have two sets (one is considerably worse) so I will make sure that all of the best stuff is in the copy I trade away.</body>

When it first came out in the early 1990&#039;s I was so impressed that I purchased four copies. I now only need to keep one and have been selling off and trading the extra copies.</body>

	<body>Played twice, excellent condition.

Complete card list below.

This includes:

All three Starter Sets, The first (and currently only) Adventure Pack, as well as something like 10-15 Boosters (and three rules booklets of course).

Good game, I just don&#039;t think I&#039;ll get to play it often.

	<body>More Wallace.

Minireview from Doug Adams who rated it a 9

Players represent some power broker behind factions of both Byzantines and Arabs. The object is to take actions over three turns, accumulating victory points for both factions, which are recorded separately. Points for both factions are totalled at the end of the game, unless one faction does really poorly, or the Arabs take Constantinople (in which case only Arab points count). Mechanics are take action/manage cubes/manage money - actions take cities, build forts and churches, and move/attack other cities. All good, hearty stuff that brings in points and money, and smacks down the opponents. Another excellent, meaty game from Warfrog, but again an hour longer than I&#039;d like. </body>

	<body>Train game, played once.

Minireview from Doug Adams. Also rated a 9:

Players develop train lines on the London Underground, trying to score points for connections and loops, as well as delivering the passenger along their tracks. Players on their turn place up to four pieces of their track on the familiar London Underground style map board, or take a branch token in lieu of track placement. Placing track can score points for reaching a terminus, or a national railways link, or by forming a loop of track. The passenger then heads off for the &quot;closest&quot; two destinations from four currently available, using the most efficient route of train lines (scoring points for their owners). Easy game to pick up, but quite meaty and thinky - reminded me a lot of Durch die Wueste mixed with TransAmerica, of all things. Excellent game that leaves me thinking how will I play it next time, which is always a good sign. Does slow down with more players - five may be a no-no with this one, and four is pushing it. </body>

I had read that the number of pieces could be variable in each set.  How many pieces are there in the version you have.

Complete except for some non-essential space junk and asteroid counters, which aren&#039;t actually used in the game anyway (I think they&#039;re for rolling your own scenarios). Box has shelf wear. Played a lot, some component wear.

The tale of components: It&#039;s missing the Blood Angels player aid, which is the same as the other two. Have subbed in Warhammer 40K gretchin figures for some of the stock gretchin, and Space Hulk door clips for the bulkhead door clips. Some (4?) figures are painted.</body>

	<body>Subbuteo - traditional red v blue teams but comes with an extra team - West Germany

No breaks or reglues but missing the (useless) corner flags

To make up for this I will include two corner kickers and two extra balls

I wanted one of these in the 70&#039;s and now have a big collection. You can have your childhood dream too

The Box is Ok for its age but has a couple of tears inside the front flap and the clear plastic cover is just for show.

	<body>Excellent 4 and at it&#039;s best 5 player game which invites bribery and negotiation by the spadeful ! My wife&#039;s wishes (she is becoming more gaming-savvy by the minute) may well preclude this from our ongoing choices for gaming . We seem to be playing 2/3 and at most 4 player games side-by-side on our Saturday evening games-fests. Mind you I would love to hang on to Santiago ....
Oh and by the way the box has a little wear and the paper money is a little worn also - otherwise in very good condition .</body>

3 card games from Gamewright for those of you who have young kids, nieces/nephews

Wear and tear on box/packaging of all 3 games 

Stone soup - rules missing, otherwise good condition - the rules are the same as card game &#039;cheat&#039; except with pretty picture cards rather than an ordinary pack of cards.

Suds - good condition

Lilly&#039;s 3 for all - rules missing - 3 simple games in one box - board game forum on boardgamegeek page explains the rules. Creasing on some of the cards.</body>

	<body>Lovely looking game with stylized hexes and a colourful layout when finished . It plays well with 2 and 3 but is more chaotic (and brutal) with more .
Box is compact but exhibits some shelf wear - components are in excellent nick .
I like this but my wife doesn&#039;t so ......:cry:</body>

	<body>This is the Face2Face edition. It is Knizia. Heaps of wooden bits and also a big handful of plastic horses with riders. I imagine they represent something. There is also a huge pepper mill piece that looks terribly out of place...but the rules assure me it has a purpose.

[ImageID=340036]

Exciting isn&#039;t it?!! Every game should have a whompin&#039; piece of curiosity lurking near the board ;) 

Cardboard is unpunched, cards are unshrinked but game has never been played. Box corners have the slightest bit of shelf scuff. 
This was a gift from a US friend last year...and truth is I think it would be great fun one day. But I just don&#039;t see it getting played anytime soon. </body>

	<body>The stickers are already on! 

This is the Second Printing if that means anything to you. Cards are still in shrink. Board is the card board one, not mounted. All blocks are accounted for and pre-stickered for your instant playing enjoyment. Now I know some of you would prefer to do this job yourself...but if you are not one of those I assure you I did an excellent job!

I think this would be great fun to play...but just don&#039;t see an opponent in my near future. I also have a slight &quot;get all expansions&quot; addiction and as such really need to dump this before I start adding even more stickers to the closet! I also am of the camp that thinks BattleLore is fun enough in this style of game...and I also quite enjoyed Memoir 44 when I played it, so may look to get that one instead. 

I know the purists think this one is THE game in this system...and I want to set it free for those of you who agree ;)</body>

	<body>I&#039;ve got HEAPS of cards for trade (from when I played competitively).

For this trade, I will toss in cards across all classes from the first TWO editions of the game. That is Heroes of Azeroth and Through the Dark Portal. 

I will put together a package of roughly three booster boxes (1080 cards or so). These will be a good assortment of commmons, uncommons and rares. I will attempt to break things down in the form of three booster boxes worth of stuff. I will of course toss in assortment of heroes as well.

As a bonus, I will toss in a booster box of Through the Dark portal cards. These are unsorted cards: I pulled the rares and epics and left all the other cards in the box. Roughly 300+ cards.

So a total of 1350+ cards in this trade. Rares, uncommons and commons. Plenty for team play and drafting.</body>

	<body>This is one of the original Z-Man prints of the game. Yes, the infamous &quot;mold edition&quot;. Now, this copy does NOT have any mold on it that I can see. What it DOES have is an outrageously heavy ink smell that persists to this day. It was quite &quot;wet&quot; when I received it, but a week of airing it out worked (mostly, we&#039;ll talk about that in a sec) and all the pieces are in excellent condition except they still have some aroma about them.

The bad news. The board has minimal warp, in fact I would think it is better then some normal boards. Nothing you really notice in that dept. BUT...and this is a big but...there is a rip. This is MY fault. While it was still wet I opened it up and I wasn&#039;t careful enough! The board is the same as Talisman 4th edition...tri-fold? To me I see it as a board with a paper cover on front and back. I only ripped it in a crease in the last third (Kessel for those who know) such that the front paper ripped but not the back. So it is not disconnected but the paper has curled up in the crease and is obvious. It does not affect anything in game as the rip doesn&#039;t mar any board elements...and some proper placement of flack guns would cover it right up! ;)

So in summery, it needs some more anti-stink work (dryer sheets?) and has a bit of a unsightly tear...but all up is still pretty good.</body>

Someone got their copy replaced by Zev (Z-Man games). Try emailing Zev. You might not even be required to mail him the entire game.

Other than being &quot;stinky&quot; I can&#039;t really see having a case for replacement. It is all in pretty good nic except the board...and as that was my fault I don&#039;t see that as a good enough reason to ask either. 

Plus I got this in the original excitement last year...too much time has passed I would think.

	<body>Played a couple of times - maybe some shelf wear on the box but components in great nick.

Rules in German but English translation provided. Components effectively language independent, e.g. voting cards with &quot;Ja&quot; rather than &quot;Yes&quot;; &quot;Nein&quot;, rather than &quot;No&quot; and I think there is a third card - at any rate - language is not an issue.</body>

	<body>Ok here we go ...
Bought this in a previous millenium as a 19 year-old . Till this day I still don&#039;t quite know why .. I&#039;ve never played it but would have loved to do so . Like many others my gaming seemed to go on hold for 20 years before my urge was rekindled in more recent times .
I hope this finds an owner who will &quot;dust it off&quot; (almost literally) and give it the good old Avalon Hill playing that it deserves .

[u][b]Now for it&#039;s condition :[/b][/u]
Box is shelf-worn and one corner is torn .
Everything else is in fine condition - the maps etc and the player tokens remain virginal and unpunched ! 

[b]HOWEVER[/b] - the rules booklet has gone missing !?!
Soften the blow by downloading the rules here on BBG ...</body>

Does this mean we have another taker for the (irregular) Adelaide Civilisation bashes.

I can get a rules copy to you, especially if you come to the ABGG meeting this Sunday.

Was just counting out the components and realised that somehow one money token and two goods tokens have gone missing. Not really a problem, as it is very rare that all of either type of token would come in to play.

	<body>This is a John Sands version from the 70s, found in an op-shop. The box is quite beat up, the corners are split, etc, and it&#039;s missing a lettuce card (I made one). This version of the game plays 4.

It&#039;s a good game; I got the 6 player version in the last math trade :)</body>

	<body>Punched, unplayed :blush:

It seems like a great game, the kind you play with the same group every week for years, getting right into the nuances till the mechanics fade away and you&#039;re playing the other players. Which is a pretty good description of the type of gaming I&#039;m not doing these days (or any time soon).

But I&#039;m tempted to hang onto it, just because it represents the sort of gaming I want to be doing one day.</body>

	<body>Very rare game , made in Germany with english translation in the rule book.Players take on the role of cat burglars and use a simultaneous bidding mechanism similar to Raj/Hols de Geier to get cards that allow them to move up a skyscraper. However, the game system does add several new features to the genre such as sabotage, stealing equipment, and unique &quot;parasite&quot; cards. In addition, the unique 3-d board is modular to allow for different difficulties and game lengths. Don&#039;t miss out, excellent condition.

	<body>In Tonga Bonga each player pilots a ship around a little group of islands with the goal of visiting four of the five remote islands and returning to Tonga Bonga Bay. Winning the race does not win the game, however. In addition to the payoffs for visiting each island (lower the more players who have visited it before you), money is also made on each turn when you roll your three dice and assign them as movement points to your opponents&#039; ships. The better &quot;salary&quot; offered, the more likely you are to attract the best dice rolls to your ships -- but then, you&#039;ll have spent more money. And most money is what wins at the end of the game. There is more than one balancing mechanism in play, with opportunities aplenty to hit the leader. It&#039;s a lighthearted dice fest, but with interesting decisions and no obvious best strategy.
Excellent condition.

	<body>Adlung Spiele card games, all in excellent condition.
Im Auftrag des Königs
&quot;Who will become First Knight? Camelot gleams under the rule of King Arthur. On his orders, knights travel through the land to bring peace and experience adventures. To fill their assignments and be successful at tournaments, the knights must constantly improve their bravery, strength, dexterity and wisdom. Because successful deeds are rewarded by the king. Who will free the beautiful maiden or best the Black Knight?&quot;
This plays like a board game, but the destinations are mapped out by placement of cards.
The entire game fits in a small Adlung-Spiele card deck box.

[ImageID=175117]
Played in a Fairy Tale Forest composed of a grid of 7x7 cards, players must try to rescue a sick princess. Goblin, Witch and Crow cross the path and impede the search. Allows for solitaire play.

[ImageID=293818]
Players hire explorers who must be sent on expeditions. Each explorer has different abilities, and each expedition has different requirements (the more difficult the expedition, the higher the reward in gold). Often it is necessary to use more than one explorer for an expedition.
The first player to win a certain amount of gold wins the game</body>

One of my favourites. The language is really only on the player mats and price lists, and an english one is included. I made a few copies of a bgg english aid so that everyone could have their own price list.

Box has moderate shelf wear and some missing ink from a long-gone price sticker. The cards, however, are in excellent condition. The basic rules are printed inside the box lid, but the full rules seem to have gone AWOL.</body>

Some subtle concavity and shelf wear to the box and there appears to be one tile missing (167/168). The original beige vinyl bag is [i]very[/i] sexy and goes perfectly with the happy family photo on the front. Love the hand-blown sand timer, too!</body>

Again with the minimal box concavity and shelf wear. This one is an abstract strategy with [size=18]big[/size] dice that you flip from face to face depending on the initial number of pips. Hmm... I seem to have acquired two sets of the rules here.</body>

[b]Vintage 4[/b]

circa 1970 (there&#039;s an advert for [i]Quandary[/i] on the back of the rules) and resplendent in its dark green vinyl zipper folio. Published by J.W. Spear &amp; Sons Ltd, Enfield, Middlesex, England. The board measures about 21cm square.

One of the letter stands has been repaired with an epoxy glue in the past. Several of the tiles have lost a couple of their 4 tiny pegs. Otherwise excellent condition for its age.</body>

	<body>Arguably THE best game on the Civil War. Just check the ratings.

I&#039;m not grognardy enough to take this on.

Complete and in great condition. Counters are in a countertray. Nice.

Lawrence Hung rates it a 9: A superlative game for a great war spanning across the whole eastern and western theatre. Supply problems are simulated with the East-West war effort dilemma for both the Union and Confederate sides. Leaders abilities are incorporated into the initiative/ movement/ combat systems. All major leaders are present in this game. More complex than other strategic game like &quot;A House Divided&quot; by GDW, the game is for the serious wargamer who wants to take an in-depth study at the war and enjoy a deep strategy thinking process. Gorgeous wargame maps for the entire United States of America. </body>

	<body>Old game, well looked after for its age. Fair amount of shelf wear on the box and the paper of the manuals has yellowed a bit. Otherwise in good condition.
Bought second hand, it was partially punched at the time and I have no reason to believe it is not complete (I recall setting it up but then putting it away again :)
Includes an Ultra magazine edition (I think this was a bonus included with the game).</body>

I have now checked the game for completeness:

- Includes Gondor &amp; Sauron. Sauron seems unplayed (some of the counters still hang together)

- Does include all maps, rules, counters, and the &quot;cover sheet&quot;. There seems to be one extra red &quot;D&quot; counter :what:

- Does not contain the two plastic dice that, according to the rules, originally came with the game. I&#039;m happy to add two dice, though, if anyone wants them :)

- There are two small ballpoint pen marks on the inside of the box lid.

	<body>Possibly the greatest time travel game ever produced, and another innovative design by Tom Lehmann.  Well worth playing!

This copy has some slight colour staining on one of the (six) Race cards and two of the (six) Reference Cards; however, none of it interferes with the readability or playability of the cards.

The box has just a little bit of typical wear.

Other than that, it&#039;s in great condition and everything is accounted for!

	<body>This offering is for all *four* of the top World Championship Decks of 2003 (when the competition was held in Berlin). Each deck is different.

All four decks in this offering have been played with a couple of times, but are still in excellent condition and complete.

From the Wizards of the Coast website:

Collector&#039;s Highlights
2003 marked the Tenth Anniversary of the Magic: The Gathering trading card game and the introduction of the Eighth Edition Core Set. As part of celebrating a decade of Magic, all cards from the Eighth Edition Core Set forward have a brand new card face. For this special Worlds tournament, Eighth Edition cards were allowed into the Standard Constructed format faster than normal, giving players a chance to use them for the first time in the biggest Magic event of the year.

Since Eighth Edition cards were the only ones at Worlds to have the new card face, the cards in the World Championship Decks for 2003 got some special treatment. Every card in these decks--including those from sets before Eighth Edition have the new card face. Unless these cards are reprinted in later sets, you&#039;ll never see them like this again.

Game Features
We gathered four of the best decks from the 2003 World Championships held in Berlin, Germany. Each of these decks was constructed by a Pro Tour player for the Standard Constructed envrionment at the time, which included the Odyssey and Onslaught blocks and the brand-new Eighth Edition Core Set. Each deck features a 60 card main deck, 15 card sideboard, 12 proxy cards along with a decklist, and factsheet. These cards are gold bordered and feature the 2003 World Championship Deck backing.

	<body>There are only 99 (out of 100) Zombies, but you get bonuses in that there are 36 (out of 30) Life Tokens and 234 (!) (out of 60!) Bullet Tokens.  (Surely you would trade one Zombie for 6 more Lives and 174 more Bullets!)

This game also comes With!!!

Plus!!!

[ImageID=238506]
(Expansion for Fluxx to commemorate the game&#039;s 10th Anniversary. The name is a bit misleading, because this is a 7 card expansion pack, not a promo. It includes 1 New Rule, 2 Actions, 2 Goals, 1 Keeper, and 1 Creeper. The Creeper is a new card type originally designed for Zombie Fluxx but first released in this expansion.)

It&#039;s Zombie-Rama with THREE Zombie items!!!

All have been played a couple of times and are complete and in excellent condition.  The Fluxx expansion pack has been opened and the cards have been added to the Zombie Fluxx game.</body>

	<body>This item is for a collection of unique and fascinating games!

In addition to the amusingly fantasy-themed trick taking game Beutelschneider, you also get its expansion, Gaukelspiel

[ImageID=172357]

and Pisa, another trick-taking game, in which the players bid for what will be trump, the goal of most or fewest tricks, and whether zero will be &quot;high&quot; or &quot;low&quot;

[ImageID=124649]

and Null Bock!, a trick-taking game with a theme of mating deer!

[ImageID=259683]

and Jumbo Grand Prix, a Knizia race-themed card game

[ImageID=60462]

and Panacea, a limited run (this is copy #47 out of 50!), self-published (by Jeph Stahl) deduction game for 3-4 players

[ImageID=159897] [ImageID=159899] [ImageID=182345]

and, finally, Pack of Flies, which is kind of like Liar&#039;s Dice/Bluff with special abilities.

All games are complete and in excellent condition!</body>

Given this never gets played I don&#039;t really want much for this (eg: card games or small games).
